After attending the North Carolina Shakespeare Festival in High Point (which featured a young Terrance Mann as Oberon in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"), he knew that the stage would be a lifelong passion. At the age of 10, he landed the lead role in the Christmas opera \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\" and, soon after, portrayed the role of Dill in \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" both shows staged at the Andy Griffith Playhouse in Mt. Airy, Griffith's hometown.  Hanner also developed a love for music, taking piano lessons, playing drums in the school band and studying voice for many years, eventually earning a spot in the esteemed choral ensemble at the North Carolina Governor's School in 1985. Having eschewed the stage for the basketball court throughout high school, he rediscovered his love for performing while attending the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

Stallone's use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. It was announced on December 7, 2010 that Stallone was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the non-participant category.\n\nIn 1977, Stallone was nominated for two Academy Awards for Rocky, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. He became the third man in history to receive these two nominations for the same film, after Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles. He received positive reviews, as well as his first Golden Globe Award win and a third Academy Award nomination, for reprising the role of Rocky Balboa in Ryan Coogler's 2015 film Creed.",

In 2010 she received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the musical Nine.\n\nCotillard, in addition to her film work, is interested in environmental activism and participated in campaigns for environmental protection. Cotillard used her high public profile to bring attention to the aims of Greenpeace, working for the environmental organization as a spokesperson, allowing the organization to use her apartment to test products. In 2005, she also contributed to Dessins pour le climat (\u201cDrawings for the Climate\u201d), a book of drawings published by Greenpeace to raise funds for the group.\n\nCotillard currently lives with French actor and director Guillaume Canet. Many reports say the couple prefers to live a simple lifestyle, and they are often spotted in cafes and shopping together in Paris. Neither star discusses their relationship with the media, although photos of the couple being affectionate regularly surface in the European tabloids.\n\nShe is a fan of Radiohead and Canadian singer Hawksley Workman; she has appeared in two of the latter's music videos, most notably \"No Reason to Cry Out your Eyes (On the Highway Tonight)\".

    "biography": "Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom is an English actor. He had his break-through roles in 2001 as the elf-prince Legolas in The Lord of the Rings and starting in 2003 as blacksmith Will Turner in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy of films, and subsequently established himself as a lead in Hollywood films, including Elizabethtown and Kingdom of Heaven. He appeared in the ensemble film New York, I Love You, and will have roles in Sympathy for Delicious and Main Street. Bloom made his professional stage debut in West End's In Celebration at the Duke of York's Theatre, St. Martin's Lane, which ended its run on 15 September 2007.\n\nOrlando Bloom was born in Canterbury, Kent, England. His mother, Sonia Constance Josephine (n\u00e9e Copeland), was born in the British section of Kolkata, India, the daughter of Betty Constance Josephine Walker and Francis John Copeland, who was a physician and surgeon. During his childhood, Bloom was told that his father was his mother's husband, South African-born Jewish anti-Apartheid novelist Harry Saul Bloom; but when he was thirteen (nine years after Harry's death), Bloom's mother revealed to him that his biological father was actually Colin Stone, his mother's partner and family friend. Stone, the principal of the Concorde International language school, was made Orlando Bloom's legal guardian after Harry Bloom's death. Bloom, who is named after the 16th century composer Orlando Gibbons, has one sister, Samantha Bloom, who was born in 1975.\n\nBloom's first appearance on the screen was as a rent boy in the 1997 film Wilde - he had a small part. Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999, he was cast in his first major role, playing Legolas in The Lord of the Rings (2001\u20132003). He had originally auditioned for the part of Faramir, who doesn't appear until the second movie but the director, Peter Jackson, cast him as Legolas instead.\n\nBloom met American actress Kate Bosworth outside a coffee shop in 2002, where he was introduced to her by a mutual friend. He met her again at the premiere of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers later that year. The two had an \"on-and-off relationship\" from 2002 until splitting up in September 2006. In late 2007, Bloom began dating Australian model Miranda Kerr. The couple's engagement was announced on June 21, 2010.\n\nBloom has said that he tries \"not to exclude [himself] from real life as much as possible\". He is a Manchester United fan and lives in London. During filming in Morocco for Kingdom of Heaven, Bloom rescued and adopted a dog, Sidi (a black Saluki mix with a white mark on his chest). Bloom is a practising Buddhist. In 2004, he became a full member of Soka Gakkai International, a lay Buddhist association affiliated with the teachings of Nichiren. Bloom has also been a part of Global Green, an environmental company, since the early 2000s. As part of his environmental involvement, he has renovated his London home to use solar panels, incorporate recycled materials, and utilize energy efficient lightbulbs. Bloom has been approached by UNICEF to act as an international ambassador.",

    "biography": "Uma Karuna Thurman (born April 29, 1970) is an American actress and model. She has performed in leading roles in a variety of films, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action movies. Following early roles in films such as Dangerous Liaisons (1988), she rose to international prominence in 1994 following her role in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award. She starred in several more films throughout the 1990s such as The Truth About Cats & Dogs, Batman & Robin, Gattaca and Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nShe won a Golden Globe Award for the miniseries Hysterical Blindness (2002). Her career was revitalized when she reunited with director Quentin Tarantino to play the central role in two Kill Bill films (2003/2004), which brought her an additional two Golden Globe Award nominations and a BAFTA Award nomination.\n\nThurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father, Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman, a New York-born professor, is a Buddhist writer and academic. Her mother, Nena von Schlebr\u00fcgge, is a model who was born in Mexico City, Mexico, of German, Swedish and Danish descent. Thurman and her siblings spent time in the Himalayan town of Almora, Uttarakhand, India, during childhood, and the Dalai Lama, to whom Robert Thurman has long been close, once visited their home. She grew up mostly in Amherst, Massachusetts, where she went to Amherst Regional Middle School, then moved to Woodstock, New York. While her father gave his children a Buddhist upbringing, she has the same name as one of the Hindu goddess Parvati's alternate names, \"Uma\", which means \"light\" in Sanskrit. Regarding religion, she now calls herself agnostic.\n\nShe has three brothers, Ganden (b. 1968), Dechen (b. 1973), and Mipam (b. 1978), and a half-sister named Taya (b. 1960), from her father's previous marriage. She is described as having been an awkward and introverted girl who was teased for her tall frame, angular bone structure, enormous feet and unusual name (sometimes using the name \u201cUma Karen\u201d instead of her birth name). When Thurman was 10 years old, a friend's mother suggested a nose job. As a child, she suffered bouts of body dysmorphic disorder, which she discussed in an interview with Talk magazine in 2001.\n\nUma attended Amherst Public Schools. In the eighth grade, she discovered her love for acting. Talent scouts noticed her performance as Abigail in a production of The Crucible and offered her the chance to act professionally. Thurman attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Massachusetts, before dropping out to pursue a career in acting.",

    "biography": "Quentin Jerome Tarantino (born March 27, 1963) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer and actor. In the early 1990s he was an independent filmmaker whose films used nonlinear storylines and aestheticization of violence. His films have earned him a variety of Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Palme d'Or Awards and he has been nominated for Emmy and Grammy Awards. In 2007, Total Film named him the 12th-greatest director of all time.\n\nTarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of Connie McHugh Tarantino Zastoupil, a health care executive and nurse born in Knoxville, and Tony Tarantino, an actor and amateur musician born in Queens, New York.\n\nTarantino's mother allowed him to quit school at age 17, to attend an acting class full time. Tarantino gave up acting while attending the acting school, saying that he admired directors more than actors. Tarantino also worked in a video rental store before becoming a filmmaker, paid close attention to the types of films people liked to rent, and has cited that experience as inspiration for his directorial career.\n\nTarantino has been romantically linked with numerous entertainers, including actress Mira Sorvino, directors Allison Anders and Sofia Coppola, actresses Julie Dreyfus and Shar Jackson and comedians Kathy Griffin and Margaret Cho. He has never married and has no children.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Quentin Tarantino, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Morgan Porterfield Freeman, Jr. is an American actor, film director, and narrator. He is noted for his reserved demeanor and authoritative speaking voice. Freeman has received Academy Award nominations for his performances in Street Smart, Driving Miss Daisy, The Shawshank Redemption and Invictus and won in 2005 for Million Dollar Baby. He has also won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nMorgan Freeman was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Mayme Edna (n\u00e9e Revere) and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, Sr., a barber who died in 1961 from liver cirrhosis. Freeman was sent as an infant to his paternal grandmother in Charleston, Mississippi. He has three older siblings. Freeman's family moved frequently during his childhood, living in Greenwood, Mississippi; Gary, Indiana; and finally Chicago, Illinois.\n\nFreeman made his acting debut at age 9, playing the lead role in a school play. He then attended Broad Street High School, currently Threadgill Elementary School, in Mississippi. At age 12, he won a statewide drama competition, and while still at Broad Street High School, he performed in a radio show based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1955, he graduated from Broad Street High School, but turned down a partial drama scholarship from Jackson State University, opting instead to work as a mechanic in the United States Air Force.\n\nFreeman moved to Los Angeles in the early 1960s and worked as a transcript clerk at Los Angeles Community College. During this period, he also lived in New York City, working as a dancer at the 1964 World's Fair, and in San Francisco, where he was a member of the Opera Ring music group. Freeman acted in a touring company version of The Royal Hunt of the Sun, and also appeared as an extra in the 1965 film The Pawnbroker. He made his off-Broadway debut in 1967, opposite Viveca Lindfors in The Nigger Lovers (about the civil rights era \"Freedom Riders\"), before debuting on Broadway in 1968's all-black version of Hello, Dolly!, which also starred Pearl Bailey and Cab Calloway.\n\nFreeman was married to Jeanette Adair Bradshaw from October 22, 1967, until 1979. He married Myrna Colley-Lee on June 16, 1984. The couple separated in December 2007. Freeman's attorney and business partner, Bill Luckett, announced in August 2008 that Freeman and his wife are in the process of divorce. He has two sons from previous relationships. He adopted his first wife's daughter and the couple also had a fourth child. Freeman lives in Charleston, Mississippi, and New York City. He has a private pilot's license, which he earned at age 65, and co-owns and operates Madidi, a fine dining restaurant, and Ground Zero, a blues club, both located in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He officially opened his second Ground Zero in Memphis, Tennessee on April 24, 2008.\n\nFreeman has publicly criticized the celebration of Black History Month and does not participate in any related events, saying, \"I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history.\" He says the only way to end racism is to stop talking about it, and he notes that there is no \"white history month\". Freeman once said on an interview with 60 Minutes' Mike Wallace: \"I am going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man.",

As a singer, Harris is probably best remembered for his recording of Jimmy Webb's song \"MacArthur Park\", which reached the top ten in sales on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in 1968.\n\nHarris, the fifth of nine children, was born in Limerick City, County Limerick, Munster, Ireland, the son of Ivan John Harris and Mildred Josephine Harty Harris.\n\nIn 1957, he married Elizabeth Rees-Williams, the daughter of David Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore. Their three children are the actor Jared Harris, the actor Jamie Harris, and the director Damian Harris. Harris and Rees-Willams divorced in 1969, and then Elizabeth married another well-known actor, Sir Rex Harrison. Harris' second marriage was to the American actress Ann Turkel, who was 16 years younger than he, and this marriage also ended in a divorce.\n\nDespite his divorces, Harris was a member of the Roman Catholic Knights of Malta, and was also dubbed a knight by the Queen of Denmark in 1985. Harris was a life long friend of actor Peter O'Toole. Harris died of Hodgkin's disease on 25 October 2002, aged 72, two and a half weeks before the American premiere of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He was replaced as Dumbledore by the Irish-born actor Sir Michael Gambon. For years, whenever he was in London, Harris resided at the Savoy Hotel. According to the hotel archivist Susan Scott, as Harris was being taken from the hotel on a stretcher, shortly before his death, he warned the diners, \"It was the food!\" Harris's remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered in The Bahamas Islands, where he had owned a home.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nDaniel Louis \"Dan\" Castellaneta (born October 29, 1957) is an American film, theatre and television actor, comedian, voice artist, singer and television writer. Noted for his long-running role as Homer Simpson on the animated television series The Simpsons, he voices many other characters on The Simpsons, including Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman.\n\nBorn in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, Castellaneta started taking acting classes at a young age. He would listen to his father's comedy records and do impressions of the artists. After graduating from Northern Illinois University, Castellaneta joined Chicago's Second City in 1983, and performed with the troupe until 1987. He was cast in The Tracey Ullman Show, which debuted in 1987. The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta to voice Homer. His voice for the character started out as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but later evolved into a more robust voice. The shorts would eventually be spun off into The Simpsons. Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work on the show as well as an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in the Field of Animation in 1993. Castellaneta has co-written four episodes of The Simpsons with his wife Deb Lacusta.\n\nCastellaneta has also had roles in several other television programs, including the live-action sitcom Sibs, The Adventures of Dynamo Duck, and the animated series Darkwing Duck, Back to the Future: The Animated Series, Earthworm Jim, Aladdin and Hey Arnold!. In 1999, he appeared in the Christmas special Olive, the Other Reindeer and won an Annie Award for his portrayal of the Postman. Castellaneta has also released a comedy CD, I Am Not Homer, and wrote and stars in a one man play titled Where Did Vincent van Gogh?",

He has received two Golden Globe Awards and has also been nominated on four occasions.\n\nCarrey began stand-up comedy in 1979, performing at Yuk Yuk's in Toronto, Ontario. After gaining prominence in 1981, he began working at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles where he was soon noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who immediately signed him to open his tour performances.\n\nCarrey, long interested in film and television, developed a close friendship with comedian Damon Wayans, which landed him a role in the sketch comedy hit In Living Color, in which he portrayed various characters during the show's 1990 season. Having had little success in television movies and several low-budget films, Carrey was cast as the title character in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective which premiered in February, 1994, making more than $72 million domestically. The film spawned a sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995), in which he reprised the role of Ventura.\n\nHigh profile roles followed when he was cast as Stanley Ipkiss in The Mask (1994) for which he gained a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, and as Lloyd Christmas in the comedy film Dumb and Dumber (1994). Between 1996 and 1999, Carrey continued his success after earning lead roles in several highly popular films including The Cable Guy (1996), Liar Liar (1997), in which he was nominated for another Golden Globe Award and in the critically acclaimed films The Truman Show and Man on the Moon, in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Both films earned Carrey Golden Globe awards. Since earning both awards \u2014 the only two in his three-decade career\u2014 Carrey continued to star in comedy films, including How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) where he played the title character, Bruce Almighty (2003) where he portrayed the role of unlucky TV reporter Bruce Nolan, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), Fun with Dick and Jane (2005), Yes Man (2008), and A Christmas Carol (2009).\n\nCarrey has also taken on more serious roles including Joel Barish in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) alongside Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst, which earned him another Golden Globe nomination, and Steven Jay Russell in I Love You Phillip Morris (2009) alongside Ewan McGregor. \u00a0 Description above from the Wikipedia article Jim Carrey, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nArthur Hindle (born July 21, 1948) is a Canadian actor and director.\n\nHindle was born in Halifax. His family moved to Toronto while he was a child. Although shy as a youngster, he grew to be a rebellious and independent teenager. This led him to travel, mostly via hitchhiking, while picking up odd jobs and meeting people from varied walks of life.\n\nBy the time he was 21, he was a father, a stockbroker and an amateur photographer. Although fairly successful as a broker, he was unfulfilled and eventually, after being inspired and touched by a Toronto Workshop Productions play, he made the commitment to leave the stock market for the theatre. He worked for a few months with TWP and got an acting agent, which led to started auditioning for commercials.\n\nIt was at this time that Hindle credits a discovery that changed his future. He was directed to the Eli Rill workshop. Eli Rill had moved to Toronto from New York, where he taught at the Actor\u2019s Studio. At this workshop, Hindle studied Method. He thrived in this environment and soon started applying his knowledge to getting acting jobs. Further inspiration for becoming an actor was his uncle, Michael Kane, with whom Art finally had the opportunity to work in the film \"The Gunfighters\".\n\nHe has made guest appearances in a long list of television programs in North America, and has also appeared in several movies, dating from 1971. His first major role was in a biker movie, \"The Proud Rider\", spawned by the popularity of Easy Rider. Hindle worked with a real motorcycle gang, Satan\u2019s Choice. It was during the making of this rather bad movie that Art almost changed his professional name to Jeremy Kane. The producers thought that Hindle should have a more showbiz-sounding name. He chose Jeremy Kane (Kane in honor of his uncle), and even though he reverted to his birth name due to urging from his uncle, his \"Jeremy Kane\" pseudonym is still connected to the film.\n\nThe next big step was being cast as Billy Duke, the best hockey player in the world, drafted by the Maple Leafs to lead them back to the playoffs in the film \"Face-Off\", Canada\u2019s first million-dollar movie. This film led to offers from Hollywood which he resisted until work dried up and Hindle - who had four children by this time - finally moved to Los Angeles.\n\nOver the years, Art has come to be known as a \u201cworking actor\u201d involved as a leading actor in some classic films and numerous pilots and series. His work in E.N.G., one of Canada\u2019s most successful series, won him a Gemini. From the early 1990s, Art has also worked as a director.\n\nHindle is married and divides his time between California and Canada. He currently stars in and directs the popular series Paradise Falls showing on cable stations in the USA and on the Showcase channel in Canada.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Art Hindle, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "One of England's most versatile character actors, Jim Broadbent was born on May 24, 1949, in Lincolnshire, the youngest son of furniture maker Roy Broadbent and sculptress Dee Broadbent. Jim attended a Quaker boarding school in Reading before successfully applying for a place at an art school. His heart was in acting, though, and he would later transfer to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). Following his 1972 graduation, he began his professional career on the stage, performing with the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and as part of the National Theatre of Brent, a two-man troupe which he co-founded. In addition to his theatrical work, Broadbent did steady work on television, working for such directors as Mike Newell and Stephen Frears. Broadbent made his film debut in 1978 with a small part in Jerzy Skolimowski's The Shout (1978). He went on to work with Frears again in The Hit (1984) and with Terry Gilliam in Time Bandits (1981) and Brazil (1985), but it was through his collaboration with Mike Leigh that Broadbent first became known to an international film audience. In 1990 he starred in Leigh's Life Is Sweet (1990), a domestic comedy that cast him as a good-natured cook who dreams of running his own business. Broadbent gained further visibility the following year with substantial roles in Neil Jordan's The Crying Game (1992) and Mike Newell's Enchanted April (1992), and he could subsequently be seen in such diverse fare as Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994), Widows' Peak (1994), Richard Loncraine's highly acclaimed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III (1995) and Little Voice (1998), the last of which cast him as a seedy nightclub owner. Appearing primarily as a character actor in these films, Broadbent took center stage for Leigh's Topsy-Turvy (1999), imbuing the mercurial W.S. Gilbert with emotional complexity and comic poignancy. Jim's breakthrough year was 2001, as he starred in three critically and commercially successful films. Many would consider him the definitive supporting actor of that year. First he starred as Bridget's dad (Colin Jones) in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), which propelled Ren\u00e9e Zellweger to an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Next came the multiple Oscar-nominated film (including Best Picture) Moulin Rouge! (2001), for which he won a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA award for his scene-stealing performance as Harold Zidler. Lastly, came the small biopic Iris (2001/I), for which he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as devoted husband John Bayley to Judi Dench's Iris Murdoch, the British novelist who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The film hit home with Jim, since his own mother had passed away from Alzheimer's in 1995.",

    "biography": "Harold George \"Harry\" Belafonte, Jr. (originally Belafonete; born March 1, 1927) is an American of Jamaican and Martiniquan descent who is a singer, actor, and social activist. He was dubbed the \"King of Calypso\" for popularizing the  Belafonte has starred in several films. His first film role was in Bright Road (1953), in which he appeared alongside Dorothy Dandridge. The two subsequently starred in Otto Preminger's hit musical Carmen Jones (1954). In 1957's Island in the Sun, there are hints of an affair between Belafonte's character and Joan Fontaine. The film also starred James Mason, Dandridge, Joan Collins, Michael Rennie, and John Justin. In 1959, he starred in and produced Robert Wise's Odds Against Tomorrow, in which he played a bank robber. He also co\u2013starred with Inger Stevens in The World, the Flesh and the Devil. Belafonte was offered the role of Porgy in Preminger's Porgy and Bess, where he would have once again starred opposite Dandridge, but he refused the role because he objected to its racial stereotyping. Dissatisfied with the film roles available to him, he returned to music during the 1960s. But in the early 1970s Belafonte appeared in more films among which are two with Poitier: Buck and the Preacher (1972) and Uptown Saturday Night (1974). In 1984, Belafonte produced and scored the musical film Beat Street, dealing with the rise of hip\u2013hop culture. Belafonte next starred in a major film again in the mid-1990s, appearing with John Travolta in the race\u2013reverse drama White Man's Burden (1995); and in Robert Altman's jazz age drama Kansas City (1996), the latter of which garnered him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also starred as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in the TV drama Swing Vote (1999). In late 2006, Belafonte appeared in the role of Nelson, a friend of an employee of the Ambassador Hotel played by Anthony Hopkins, in Bobby, Emilio Estevez's ensemble drama about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.  Belafonte's success did not protect him from racial discrimination, particularly in the American South. Belafonte refused to perform there from 1954 until 1961. In 1960, he appeared in a campaign commercial for Democratic Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. Kennedy later named Belafonte cultural advisor to the Peace Corps. At the ACLU of Northern California's annual Bill of Rights Day Celebration In December 2007, Belafonte gave the keynote address and was awarded the Chief Justice Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award. The 2011 Sundance Film Festival featured the documentary film \"Sing Your Song\", a biographical film focusing on Belafonte's contribution to and his leadership in the civil rights movement in America and his endeavors to promote social justice globally.  Belafonte and Marguerite Byrd were married from 1948 to 1957. They have two daughters: Adrienne and Shari. Shari Belafonte, married to Sam Behrens, is a photographer, model, singer and actor. On March 8, 1957, Belafonte married second wife Julie Robinson. They have two children, David and Gina Belafonte. David Belafonte (a former model and actor) is an Emmy\u2013winning producer and the executive director of the family\u2013held company Belafonte Enterprises Inc. He married Danish model, singer and TV personality Malena Belafonte, born Mathiesen, who won silver in Dancing with the Stars in Denmark in 2009. In April 2008, Belafonte married Pamela Frank.",

Hawk gained significant fame for completing the first 900 as well as his licensed video game titles distributed by Activision. He is widely considered one of the most successful and influential pioneers of modern vertical skateboarding.\n\nRaised in San Diego, California, Hawk was described as being \"hyperactive\" as a child. His parents supported his skateboarding because it served as an outlet for his excessive energy, and as Hawk's skills developed, he became a professional skateboarder at age fourteen. In 1999, he became the first skater to land a 900. In 2002, he created the Boom Boom HuckJam, an extreme sports exhibition and tour which launched in Las Vegas. Throughout his career, Hawk has made numerous appearances in films and other media, as well as his own series of video games. He has also been involved in various philanthropic activities including his own Tony Hawk Foundation which helps build skateparks in underprivileged areas, and also including collaborations with other athletes in the charity Athletes for Hope.

    "biography": "In 1935, after high school and a brief marriage in San Bernardino, California, Frances Ridste ran away to San Francisco to work as a nightclub dancer and band singer under the stage name Carole Landis. She got to Hollywood at age 17 in 1936 and got mostly extra work, but in 1937 she landed a contract with Warner Bros. However, Warners gave her mostly bit parts in B pictures and in the chorus of Busby Berkeley pictures for the 15 films she made for them. Her \"break\" came when Hal Roach cast her as the skin-clad lead in his hit One Million B.C. (1940) and in three fine comedies, then sold her contract to 20th Century-Fox. She played \"B\" leads and \"A\" supporting roles in her first 12 Fox films, with a notable dramatic performance in I Wake Up Screaming (1941). Critics dwelled on her fresh-faced beauty, seldom mentioning her acting and comedy potential. Carole wrote a book about her first wartime USO tour, entertaining troops in England and North Africa; in the film version, Four Jills in a Jeep (1944), you can get a glimpse of the kind of talent she really had, and which Fox was wasting. Absent from film work most of that year because of USO tours in the Pacific, Carol returned to Hollywood weakened by amoebic dysentery, malaria, and near-fatal pneumonia only to find the film dismissed as \"self-praise\". After Having Wonderful Crime (1945)--perhaps her best comedy--and two B pictures, her Fox contract was dropped. Ostracized in Hollywood due to her ardent feminism and rumors about sexual peccadillos, she made her last two films in England. With a stalled career, poor health, failed marriages, financial problems, and the ending of a torrid affair with married Rex Harrison, Carole Landis committed suicide with Seconal in 1948. Intelligent, generous, talented and gorgeous, she was only 29.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nDame Olivia Mary de Havilland DBE (/d\u0259\u02c8h\u00e6v\u026al\u0259nd/; born July 1, 1916) is a British-American actress, whose career spanned from 1935 to 1988. She appeared in 49 feature films, and was one of the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She is best known for her early screen performances in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and Gone with the Wind (1939), and her later award-winning performances in To Each His Own (1946), The Snake Pit (1948), and The Heiress (1949).\n\nBorn in Tokyo to British parents, de Havilland and her younger sister, actress Joan Fontaine, moved with their mother to California in 1919. They were brought up by their mother Lilian, a former stage actress who taught them drama, music, and elocution. Olivia de Havilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1935. During her career, she often played demure ing\u00e9nues opposite popular leading men, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made nine films. They became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. She achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedy films, such as The Great Garrick (1937), and in Westerns, such as Dodge City (1939). Her natural beauty and refined acting style made her particularly effective in historical period dramas, such as Anthony Adverse (1936), and romantic dramas, such as Hold Back the Dawn (1941). In her later career, she was most successful in dramas, such as Light in the Piazza (1962), and unglamorous roles in psychological dramas including Hush\u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).\n\nIn addition to her film career, de Havilland continued her work in the theatre, appearing three times on Broadway. She also worked in television, appearing in the successful miniseries, Roots: The Next Generations (1979), and television feature films, such as Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna, for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. During her film career, de Havilland won two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup. For her contributions to the motion picture industry, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. For her lifetime contribution to the arts, she received the National Medal of Arts from President George W. Bush, and was appointed a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nDe Havilland and Joan Fontaine are the only siblings to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category. A lifelong rivalry between the two actresses resulted in an estrangement that lasted over three decades. De Havilland has lived in Paris since 1956, and celebrated her 100th birthday on July 1, 2016. In June 2017, two weeks before her 101st birthday, de Havilland was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to drama. She is the oldest woman ever to receive the honour. In a statement, she called it \"the most gratifying of birthday presents\".",

    "biography": "Reginald Lawrence Knowles (11 November 1911 \u2013 23 December 1995) was an English film actor who renamed himself Patric Knowles, a name which reflects his Irish descent. He appeared in films of the 1930s through the 1970s. He made his film debut in 1933, and played either first or second film leads throughout his career.\n\nIn his first American film, Give Me Your Heart (1936), released in Great Britain as Sweet Aloes, Knowles was cast as a titled Englishman of means.\n\nWhile making The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936) at Lone Pine, California, he befriended Errol Flynn, whose acquaintance he had made when both were under contract to Warner Bros. in England. Since that film, in which Knowles played the part of Capt. Perry Vickers, the brother of Flynn's Maj. Geoffrey Vickers, he was cast more frequently as straitlaced characters alongside Flynn's flamboyant ones, notably as Will Scarlet in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Both actors starred as well in Four's A Crowd, also in 1938.\n\nMore than two decades after Flynn's death, biographer Charles Higham sullied Flynn's memory by accusing him of having been a fascist sympathizer and Nazi spy. Knowles, who had served in World War II as a flying instructor in the RCAF, came to Flynn's defense, writing Rebuttal for a Friend as an epilogue to Tony Thomas' Errol Flynn: The Spy Who Never Was (Citadel Press, 1990) ISBN 080651180X.\n\nKnowles was a freelance film actor from 1939 until his last film appearance in 1973. In the 1940s, he was known for playing protagonists in a number of horror films, including The Wolf Man (1941) and Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman (1943).\n\nKnowles was also cast as comic foils in a number of comedies such as Abbott and Costello's Who Done It? (1942) and Hit The Ice (1943). He also appeared opposite Jack Kelly in a 1957 episode of the television series Maverick called \"The Wrecker\", which was based on a Robert Louis Stevenson adventure and co-starred James Garner.\n\nKnowles was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame and wrote a novel called Even Steven (Vantage Press, 1960) ASIN B0006RMC2G. He was cremated. His ashes were either given to a friend or family.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Patric Knowles, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Hale was born Rufus Edward Mackahan in Washington, D.C. He studied to be an opera singer and also had success as an inventor. Among his innovations were a sliding theater chair (to allow spectators to slide back to admit newcomers rather than standing), the hand fire extinguisher, and greaseless potato chips.\n\nHis first film role was in the 1911 silent movie The Cowboy and the Lady. He played \"Little John\" in the 1922 film Robin Hood, with Douglas Fairbanks and Wallace Beery, reprised the role 16 years later in The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone, then played him yet again in Rogues of Sherwood Forest in 1950 with John Derek as Robin Hood's son, an unprecedented 28-year span of portrayals of the same character in theatrical films. Hale played Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), featuring in a pivotal confrontation with the Earl of Essex, portrayed by Flynn.\n\nHis other films include the 1922 epic The Trap with Lon Chaney, 1928's Skyscraper; as well as Fog Over Frisco with Bette Davis; Miss Fane's Baby Is Stolen with Baby LeRoy and William Frawley; The Little Minister with Katharine Hepburn; and It Happened One Night with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert; all released in 1934; the 1937 film Stella Dallas with Barbara Stanwyck; High, Wide, and Handsome with Irene Dunne and Dorothy Lamour; The Fighting 69th with James Cagney and Pat O'Brien; They Drive By Night with George Raft and Humphrey Bogart; Manpower with Edward G. Robinson, Marlene Dietrich, and George Raft; Virginia City with Errol Flynn, Randolph Scott, and Humphrey Bogart; and as the cantankerous Sgt. McGee in the 1943 movie This Is the Army with Irving Berlin. He also co-starred with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the successful western film Dodge City (1939) where he played the slightly dimwitted but likeable and comical Rusty Hart, sidekick to Flynn's character, Sheriff Wade Hatton.

    "biography": "Rutger Oelsen Hauer (23 January 1944 - 19 July 2019) was a Dutch film actor. He was well known for his roles in Flesh + Blood, Blind Fury, Blade Runner, The Hitcher, Nighthawks, Sin City, Ladyhawke, The Blood of Heroes and Batman Begins.\n\nHauer was born in Breukelen, Netherlands, to drama teachers Arend and Teunke, and grew up in Amsterdam. Since his parents were very occupied with their careers, he and his three sisters (one older, two younger) were raised mostly by nannies. At the age of 15, Hauer ran off to sea and spent a year scrubbing decks aboard a freighter. Returning home, he worked as an electrician and a carpenter for three years while attending acting classes at night school. He went on to join an experimental troupe, with which he remained for five years before he was cast in the lead role in the very successful 1969 television series Floris, a Dutch Ivanhoe-like medieval action drama. The role made him famous in his native country.\n\nHauer's career changed course when director Paul Verhoeven cast him as the lead in Turkish Delight (1973) (based on the Jan Wolkers book of the same name). The movie found box-office favour abroad as well as at home, and within two years, its star was invited to make his English-language debut in the British film The Wilby Conspiracy (1975). Set in South Africa and starring Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier, the film was an action melodrama with a focus on apartheid. Hauer's supporting role, however, was barely noticed in Hollywood, and he returned to Dutch films for several years. Hauer made his American debut in the Sylvester Stallone vehicle Nighthawks (1981), cast as a psychopathic and cold-blooded terrorist named \"Wolfgar\" (after a character in the Old English poem Beowulf). The following year, he appeared in arguably his most famous and acclaimed role as the eccentric, violent, yet sympathetic replicant Roy Batty in Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi thriller, Blade Runner.\n\nHauer was a dedicated environmentalist. He fought for the release of Greenpeace's co-founder, Paul Watson, who was convicted in 1994 for sinking a Norwegian whaling vessel. Hauer has also established an AIDS awareness foundation called the Rutger Hauer Starfish Foundation. He married his second wife, Ineke, in 1985 (they had been together since 1968); and he has one child, actress Aysha Hauer, who was born in 1966 and who made him a grandfather in 1988. In April 2007, he published his autobiography All Those Moments: Stories of Heroes, Villains, Replicants, and Blade Runners (co-written with Patrick Quinlan) where he discussed many of his movie roles. Proceeds of the book go to Hauer's Starfish Foundation.",

    "biography": "Natividad was born in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, the eldest of nine children, and did not speak English until she was 10. At that time, her mother married a U.S. citizen and they moved to Texas. Natividad attended high school in El Paso, where she was her senior class president. After moving to California, she worked as a maid and cook for Stella Stevens and as a key-punch operator for IBM before turning to go-go dancing to make ends meet. Her stage name Kitten came from her shyness. At age 21, she had her first breast implant surgery in Tijuana (where it was legal) on the advice of her agent. Kitten Natividad was introduced to Russ Meyer by fellow dancer Shari Eubank, a performer in Meyer's 1975 film Supervixens. Meyer hired her to narrate his movie Up!, where she was shown sitting nude in a tree, quoting the poetry of Hilda Doolittle and acting as a Greek chorus to the nonsensical action. Meyer was so impressed he wanted her to star in his next feature, Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens, one of several collaborations between Meyer and film critic Roger Ebert. He paid for a second breast enhancement and voice lessons to eliminate her accent. She left her husband for Meyer during the filming, and they lived together as a couple for most of the next 15 years. After this, Natividad moved into pornographic modeling, mainly doing glamour or girl-girl shoots with the likes of Candy Samples, Uschi Digard, and Patty Plenty. The appearances increased her dancing income many times over. She incorporated a giant champagne glass into her act (similar to Lili St. Cyr), accompanied by the Bobby Darin hit \"Splish Splash.\" She appeared as a guest on The Dating Game, one of a number of game shows that Chuck Barris produced. During the 1980s, Natividad began appearing in pornographic productions, initially limiting her performances to appearing topless. Eventually, however, she graduated to engaging in hardcore performances, usually with younger men and women. She also founded the private photo and video studio Kitten Klub. She famously appeared as a stripper at the bachelor party held by Sean Penn to celebrate his 1985 marriage to Madonna. In 2001, Natividad starred in the cult film comedy The Double-D Avenger, directed by William Winckler, and in it, she was reunited with fellow Russ Meyer stars, actress Haji from Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! and Raven De La Croix from Russ Meyer's film Up! In The Double-D Avenger, Kitten Natividad plays Chastity Knott, a woman who becomes a busty costumed crime fighter",

    "biography": "Luis Bu\u00f1uel Portol\u00e9s was a Spanish filmmaker who worked in Spain, Mexico and France.\n\nWhen Luis Bu\u00f1uel died at age 83, his obituary in the New York Times called him \"an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later\". His first pictur e\u2014made in the silent era\u2014 was called \"the most famous short film ever made\" by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film \u2014made 48 years later\u2014 won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Bu\u00f1uel's work \"the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality... scandalous and subversive\".\n\nOften associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Bu\u00f1uel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and an array of genres, including experimental film, documentary, melodrama, satire, musical, erotica, comedy, romance, costume dramas, fantasy, crime film, adventure, and western. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Bu\u00f1uel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, \"Bu\u00f1uel nearly always made Bu\u00f1uel films\".\n\nSix of Bu\u00f1uel's films are included in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, which is tied with John Ford for second most, and he ranks number 14 on their list of the top 250 directors.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSaadi Yacef (born January 20, 1928) was one of the leaders of Algeria's National Liberation Front during his country's war of independence. He is currently a Senator in Algeria's Council of the Nation.\n\nYacef was born in Algiers. He started his working life as an apprentice baker. In 1945 he joined the Parti du Peuple Algerien, a nationalist party which the French authorities soon outlawed, after which it was reconstituted as the Mouvement pour le Triomphe des Libertes Democratiques (MTLD). From 1947 to 1949 Yacef served in the MTLD's paramilitary wing, the Organisation Secrete. After the OS was broken up Yacef moved to France and lived there until 1952, when he returned to Algeria to work again as a baker.\n\nYacef joined the FLN at the start of the Algerian War in 1954. By May 1956 he was the FLN's military chief of the Zone Autonome d'Alger (Autonomous Zone of Algiers), making him one of the leaders on the Algerian side in the Battle of Algiers. He was captured by French troops on September 24, 1957 and eventually sentenced to death. General Paul Aussaresses later asserted that while in custody, Yacef Saadi betrayed the FLN and the Algerian cause by providing the French army with the location of Ali la Pointe, another leading FLN commander. Yacef has denied it, and historian Darius Rejali considers the accusation as highly suspect. He was ultimately pardoned by the French government after Charles de Gaulle's 1958 return to power.\n\nYacef claims to have written his memoirs of the battle while in Prison, although he was known for being an illiterate. The writings were published in 1962 as Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger. After the Algerian War, Yacef helped produce Gillo Pontecorvo's film The Battle of Algiers (1966), based on Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger. Yacef played a character modeled on his own experiences in the battle.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Saadi Yacef, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

Djimon Hounsou was born in Cotonou, Benin, in 1964, to lbertine and Pierre Hounsou. He immigrated to Lyon in France at the age of thirteen with his brother, Edmond. In 1987, he became a model and established a career in Paris. He moved to the U.S. in 1990. One year before obtaining his college degree, he dropped out of school. In the 1989 he appeared in a music video of Straight Up by Paula Abdul. Hounsou's film debut was in the 1990 Sandra Bernhard film Without You I\u2019m Nothing, and he has had television parts on Beverly Hills, 90210 and ER and a guest starring role on Alias, but received a larger role in the science fiction film Stargate. His first on-screen appearance was in the 1990 Janet Jackson video \u201cLove Will Never Do (Without You).\u201d He also starred in a 2002 Gap commercial directed by Peter Lindbergh, dancing to a rendition of John Lee Hooker's \"Boom Boom\" by Arrested Development's Baba Oje.

Her first film was with Benigni in 1983, the comedy Tu Mi Turbi (\"You Upset Me\"). She later appeared in two Jim Jarmusch films, Down by Law and Mystery Train.\n\nBraschi's two most successful collaborations with her husband have been Johnny Stecchino (1992) and La Vita \u00e8 Bella (Life is Beautiful) (1997). The first, an Italian comedy that cast the actress as the girlfriend of a mobster (Benigni), was a huge hit in Italy; while the second, in which Braschi played the wife of an Italian Jew (Benigni) imprisoned in a concentration camp, was a widely-praised success that launched both Braschi and her husband into the international spotlight.\n\nShe was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award as a cast member of Life is Beautiful. She is also a David di Donatello award winner (Italy's equivalent of the Oscars).\n\nIn 2002, she was a member of the jury at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nIn 2010 she has returned to theatre starring in \"Tradimenti\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Nicoletta Braschi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Ventura served as a U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team member during the period of the Vietnam War. After leaving the military, he embarked on a professional wrestling career from 1975 to 1986, taking the ring name Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura. He had a long tenure in the World Wrestling Federation as a performer and color commentator, and was inducted into the Federation's Hall of Fame in 2004. Apart from wrestling, Ventura also pursued a film career, appearing in films such as Predator (1987). Ventura first entered politics as Mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, from 1991 to 1995. Four years after his mayoral term ended, Ventura was the Reform Party candidate in the Minnesota gubernatorial election of 1998, running a low-budget campaign centered on grassroots events and unusual ads that urged citizens not to \"vote for politics as usual\". Ventura's campaign was successful, with him narrowly and unexpectedly defeating both the Democratic and Republican candidates. The highest elected official to ever win an election on a Reform Party ticket, Ventura left the Reform Party a year after taking office amid internal fights for control over the party. As governor, Ventura oversaw reforms of Minnesota's property tax as well as the state's first sales tax rebate. Other initiatives taken under Ventura included construction of the METRO Blue Line light rail in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, and cuts in income taxes. Ventura left office in 2003, deciding not to run for re-election. After leaving office, Ventura became a visiting fellow at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2004. He has since also hosted a number of television shows and has written several political books. Ventura remains politically active and currently hosts a show on Ora TV called Off the Grid. He has publicly contemplated a run for President of the United States in 2016.",

    "biography": "Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor was an American stand-up comedian, actor, film director, social critic, satirist, writer, and MC.  Pryor was known for uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed colorful vulgarities, and profanity, as well as racial epithets. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians of all time: receiving praise from notable comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld, Bob Newhart, and Bill Cosby.  His body of work includes the concert movies and recordings starting in the 70s and spanning three decades. He also starred in numerous films as an actor, in both comedic and dramatic roles. He collaborated on many projects with actor Gene Wilder and actor/comedian/writer Paul Mooney.  Pryor won an Emmy Award (1973), and five Grammy Awards (1974, 1975, 1976, 1981, and 1982). In 1974, he also won two American Academy of Humor awards and the Writers Guild of America Award. The first ever Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor was presented to him in 1998. Pryor is listed at Number 1 on Comedy Central's list of all-time greatest stand-up comedians.",

After playing two roles in one of Evans's productions of Hamlet, he played Horatio opposite Evans's Hamlet in a 1953 Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of the work, the most prestigious American production of the play seen on TV up to that time.\n\nAlso on television he played roles on The Edge of Night in the 1950s.

Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) and The Grissom Gang (1971). In 1976, Addy appeared in Paddy Chayefsky's Network, directed by Sidney Lumet. They would work together again in The Verdict., in which Addy played a doctor who nearly derails Paul Newman's case against a hospital for malpractice. Another of Addy's best-remembered roles was that of Lt. Cdr. Alvin Kramer, who unsuccessfully tries to warn American officials of the impending attack on Pearl Harbor in Tora! Tora!

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nPierre Cl\u00e9menti (28 September 1942 \u2013 27 December 1999) was a French actor.\n\nBorn in Paris, Cl\u00e9menti studied drama and began his acting career in the theatre. He secured his first minor screen roles in 1960 in Yves All\u00e9gret's Chien de pique performing alongside Eddie Constantine. Arguably, his most famous role was that of gangster lover of bourgeois prostitute Catherine Deneuve in Belle de jour, the 1967 classic by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, in whose film La voie lact\u00e9e he played the Devil. He appeared in several highly regarded films of the period, working with many of Europe's best known directors, including Luchino Visconti (The Leopard), Pier Paolo Pasolini (Pigsty) and Bernardo Bertolucci (The Conformist and Partner). Other directors he has worked with are Liliana Cavani, Glauber Rocha, Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3 and Philippe Garrel.\n\nIn 1972, his career was derailed after he was sentenced to prison for allegedly possessing or using drugs. Due to insufficient evidence, Cl\u00e9menti was released after 17 months; later he penned a book about his time in prison. After his release he played the role of ever-optimistic sailor of the Potemkin in Dusan Makavejev's scandalous movie Sweet movie, and the role of the seductive saxophone player Pablo in Fred Haines's film adaptation of Herman Hesse's novel Steppenwolf. Throughout his career, he continued to be active on-stage.\n\nHe was also involved with the French underground film movement, directing several of his own films, which often featured fellow underground filmmakers and actors. Visa de censure no X was an experimental work made up of two of films. New Old was a feature length work released in 1978 in which Viva appeared. La Revolution ce ne'est qu'un debut, continuons le combat, followed by In the shadow of the blue rascal and Sun.

Since then, she has appeared in films such as Cracks, Centurion, and the 2011 remake of Fright Night. Although Poots has never formally trained as an actress, according to Giles Hattersley, a practical apprenticeship may have served her well, as she is \"compellingly natural\" in front of the camera.",

What began as a teenage avocation has led to regular public performances at various small venues in his hometown of Manhattan, with occasional appearances at various jazz festivals. Allen joined the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and the New Orleans Funeral Ragtime Orchestra in performances that provided the film score for his 1973 comedy Sleeper, and performed in a rare European tour in 1996, which became the subject of the documentary Wild Man Blues.",

Union starred opposite Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in the blockbuster film Bad Boys II and played a medical doctor in the CBS drama Series City of Angels. She starred with LL Cool J and Meagan Good in Deliver Us from Eva in 2003.\n\nUnion was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the daughter of Theresa and Sylvester Union. At the age of eight, her family moved to Pleasanton, California, where she grew up and attended Foothill High School. In high school, Union was an all-star point guard in basketball and a year-round athlete, also playing in soccer and running track. She went on to the University of Nebraska before moving on to Cuesta College. She eventually transferred to UCLA and earned a degree in sociology. While studying there, she interned at the Judith Fontaine Modeling &amp; Talent Agency to earn extra academic credits. Invited by the agency's owner, Judith Fontaine, Union started working as a model to pay off college loans.\n\nHer acting career started with minor roles. Most were in teen movies such as 10 Things I Hate About You and Love and Basketball. In 1997, Union appeared in a sixth-season episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as the Klingon N'Garen. She also appeared in Sister, Sister as Vanessa, in Smart Guy as Denise, and in five episodes of 7th Heaven as Keesha Hamilton. In 2000, Union landed the role of Isis in the cheerleading movie Bring it On opposite Kirsten Dunst. Bring It On helped push Union into the mainstream and she began gaining more exposure. She was cast in her first leading role in the 2003 film Deliver Us from Eva with rapper L.L. Cool J. The film received fair reviews from critics and it showed that Union was a leading lady.\n\nUnion landed the role of Will Smith's girlfriend Syd in the film Bad Boys II, a box office success grossing over $273 million worldwide. Union starred with Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx in the film Breakin' All the Rules in 2004. She then starred in the short-lived 2005 ABC series Night Stalker.

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nStephen Tyrone Colbert ( born May 13, 1964) is an American political satirist, writer, comedian, television host, and actor. He is the host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a satirical news show in which Colbert portrays a caricatured version of conservative political pundits.\n\nColbert originally studied to be an actor, but became interested in improvisational theatre when he met famed Second City director Del Close while attending Northwestern University. He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago; among his troupe mates were comedians Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris, with whom he developed the critically acclaimed sketch comedy series Exit 57.\n\nColbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived Dana Carvey Show before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series Strangers with Candy. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet. It was his work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series The Daily Show, however, that first introduced him to a wide audience.\n\nIn 2005, he left The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to host a spin-off series, The Colbert Report. Following The Daily Show's news-parody concept, The Colbert Report is a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows such as The O'Reilly Factor. Since its debut, the series has established itself as one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert three Emmy Award nominations and an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006. Colbert was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in 2006. His book I Am America (And So Can You!) was No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Stephen Colbert, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nFrancisco Rabal (March 8, 1926 \u2013 August 29, 2001), perhaps better known as Paco Rabal, was a Spanish actor born in \u00c1guilas, a small town in the province of Murcia, Spain.\n\nIn 1936, after the Spanish Civil War broke out. Rabal and his family left Murcia and moved to Madrid. Young Francisco had to work as a street salesboy and in a chocolate factory. When he was 13 years old, he left school to work as an electrician at Estudios Chamart\u00edn.\n\nRabal got some sporadic jobs as an extra. D\u00e1maso Alonso and other people advised him to try his luck with a career in theater.\n\nDuring the following years, he got some roles in theater companies such as Lope de Vega or Mar\u00eda Guerrero. It was there that he met actress Asunci\u00f3n Balaguer; they married and remained together for the rest of Rabal's life. Their daughter, Teresa Rabal, is also an actor.\n\nIn 1947, Rabal got some regular jobs in theater. He used his full name, Francisco Rabal, as stage name. However, the people who knew him always called him Paco Rabal. (Paco is the familiar form for Francisco.) \"Paco Rabal\" became his unofficial stage name.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Rabal began acting in movies as an extra, but it was not until 1950 that he was first cast in speaking roles, and played romantic leads and rogues. He starred in three films directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel - Nazar\u00edn (1959), Viridiana (1961) and Belle de jour (1967).\n\nWilliam Friedkin thought of Rabal for the French villain of his 1971 movie The French Connection. However, he could not remember the name of \"that Spanish actor\". Mistakenly, his staff hired another Spanish actor, Fernando Rey. Friedkin discovered that Rabal did not speak English or French, so he decided to keep Rey. Rabal has previously worked with Rey in Viridiana. Rabal did, however, work with Friedkin in the much less successful but Academy Award-nominated cult classic Sorcerer (1977), a remake of The Wages of Fear (1953).\n\nThroughout his career, Rabal worked in France, Italy and Mexico with directors such as Gillo Pontecorvo, Michelangelo Antonioni, Luchino Visconti, Valerio Zurlini, Jacques Rivette and Alberto Lattuada.\n\nIt is widely considered that Rabal's best performances came after Francisco Franco's death on 1975. In the 1980s, Rabal starred in Los santos inocentes, winning the Award as Best Actor in Cannes Film Festival, in El Disputado Voto del Se\u00f1or Cayo and also in the TV series Juncal. In 1989, he was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. In the 1999 he played the character of Francisco Goya in Carlos Saura Goya en Burdeos, winning a Goya Award as Best Actor.\n\nFrancisco Rabal is the only Spanish actor to have received a honoris causa doctoral degree from the University of Murcia.\n\nRabal's final movie was Dagon, a film which was dedicated to him right before the credits. The dedication read \"Dedicated to Francisco Rabal, a wonderful actor and even better human being.\"\n\nRabal died in 2001 from compensatory dilating emphysema, while on an airplane travelling to Bordeaux, when he was coming back from receiving an Award at Montreal Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Francisco Rabal, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Academy Award-nominated actress Maggie Gyllenhaal was born on November 16, 1977, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. Her parents, Naomi Foner (n\u00e9e Achs) and Stephen Gyllenhaal, are both filmmakers, and her brother is actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Her mother is from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, while her father has Swedish, English, Swiss-German, and German ancestry.\n\nMaggie made her film debut in Stephen's film Waterland (1992). She had sporadic roles throughout her teenage years, though she stepped away to receive a degree in literature from Columbia University in 1999. In addition, she studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, which helped with her post-graduation transition back in to acting.\n\nSoon after graduation, Gyllenhaal appeared in supporting roles in Cecil B. DeMented (2000) and alongside brother Jake Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko (2001). Her breakout role came a bit later, when she took on the daring, sexy title role in Secretary (2002). That part wound up earning her a Golden Globe nomination, and Gyllenhaal followed that up with supporting turns in 40 Days and 40 Nights (2002), Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), Adaptation. (2002), and Mona Lisa Smile (2003), among other movies.\n\nGyllenhaal received her second Golden Globe nomination for playing a recent prison parolee in Sherrybaby (2006). She followed that up with roles in World Trade Center (2006) and Stranger Than Fiction (2006), and then replaced Katie Holmes in the role of Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight (2008).\n\nIn 2009, Gyllenhaal received great acclaim for her role opposite Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart (2009), which earned the actress her first Oscar nomination. Since then, Gyllenhaal has been seen in Nanny McPhee Returns (2010), Hysteria (2011) and Won't Back Down (2012).\n\nGyllenhaal has two children with husband Peter Sarsgaard, whom she married in 2009.",

He went on to become a series regular on ABC's Fridays. Prior to Seinfeld, he made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows including Cheers, Night Court, Miami Vice and St. Elsewhere. His film credits include So I Married an Axe Murderer, Airheads, Young Doctors in Love, Problem Child, Coneheads and UHF. During the run of Seinfeld, he made a guest appearance in Mad About You. After Seinfeld, Richards starred in his own sitcom, The Michael Richards Show, which lasted less than one season.\n\nAfter his series was cancelled, Richards returned to his roots performing stand up comedy. After inciting some media furor in late 2006 over explosively addressing audience members at a comedy show with repeated racial epithets, Richards announced his retirement from stand-up in 2007. Most recently, Richards appeared as himself in the seventh season of Curb Your Enthusiasm in 2009, acting alongside his fellow Seinfeld cast members for the first time since Seinfeld's finale.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Michael Richards, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Lucie Mannheim (30 April 1899 \u2013 28 July 1976) was a German singer and actress.\n\nMannheim was born in Berlin\u2013K\u00f6penick where she studied drama and quickly became a popular figure appearing on stage in plays and musicals. Among other roles, she played Nora in Ibsen's A Doll's House, Marie in B\u00fcchner's Woyzeck, and Juliet in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. She also began a film career in 1923, appearing in several silent and sound films including Atlantik (1929) \u2013 the first of many versions of the story of the ill-fated RMS Titanic. The composer Walter Goetze wrote his operetta Die g\u00f6ttliche Jette (1931) especially for Mannheim.  However, as a Jew she was obliged to stop acting in 1933, when her contract at the State Theatre was cancelled. She promptly left Germany, first to Czechoslovakia, then to Britain. She appeared in several films there, notably as the doomed spy Annabella Smith in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 version of The 39 Steps.\n\nDuring World War II she appeared in several films, as well as broadcasting propaganda to Germany \u2013 including performing an anti-Hitler version of Lili Marleen\u00a0 in 1943. In 1941, she married the actor Marius Goring.\n\nShe returned to Germany in 1948 and resumed her career as an actress on stage and in film. In 1955 she joined the cast of the British television series The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel as Countess La Valliere. She made her final English-language film appearance in the 1965 film Bunny Lake Is Missing. Her last appearance was in a 1970 TV movie. She died in Braunlage.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Lucie Mannheim, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After graduation he found a minor role as Sailor #1 in River Phoenix's Dogfight (1991), then somewhat more substantial roles in Encino Man (1992) and School Ties (1992). He expresses a preference for playing \"fish out of water\" men. Five more years of supporting work led finally to the title role in George of the Jungle (1997), a role which fully utilized his charm and beefy good looks, as well as offering him a chance to show off his comic talents. He describes this role as the one which dramatically altered his career. Critical raves for his role in Gods and Monsters (1998) pointed to yet another dimension to his dramatic persona.",

Ryder's first significant role came in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice (1988) as a goth teenager, which won her critical and commercial recognition. After making various appearances in film and television, Ryder continued her career with the cult film Heathers (1989), a controversial satire of teenage suicide and high school life, which drew Ryder further critical and commercial attention. Having played diverse roles in many well-received films, Ryder won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination in the same category for her role in The Age of Innocence in 1993, as well as another Academy Award nomination for Little Women the following year for Best Actress. In 2000, Ryder received a star on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California. Ryder's personal life has been widely reported by the media. Her relationship with actor Johnny Depp in the early 1990s was highly publicized and received much scrutiny by the media and tabloid press. A much talked about 2001 shoplifting incident led to a four-year hiatus from acting. She has also revealed her personal struggle with anxiety and depression, briefly checking into a clinic. In 2006, Ryder returned to the screen, and some media outlets called her performance \"a remarkable comeback\" to acting, having appeared in high-profile films such as Star Trek. In 2010, she was nominated for two Screen Actors Guild Awards, as the lead actress of When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story, and as part of the cast of Black Swan.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Winona Ryder, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He featured in many other TV shows and movies. He won the award for best actor at the 8th Hochi Film Award for Detective Story and The Family Game. He specialized in physical action movies. The 1989 movie Black Rain\u2014 directed by Ridley Scott and starring Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia\u2014 opened the door for Matsuda as an international actor. However, shortly after he made this movie, he died due to bladder cancer. He was survived by his second wife and three young children (including Ryuhei And Shota, both of whom became actors).

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nMickey Rooney (born September 23, 1920\u00a0\u2013 April 6, 2014) was an American actor of film, television, Broadway, radio, and vaudeville.  Beginning as a child actor, his career extended over 90 years, making  him one of the most enduring performers in show business history. He  appeared in more than 300 films and was one of the last surviving stars  of the silent film era, having one of the longest careers in the  medium's history.\n\nAt the height of a career that was marked by precipitous declines and raging comebacks, he played the role of Andy Hardy in a series of fifteen films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A prolific talent, he became a noted character actor later in his career, and could sing, dance, clown and play various musical instruments. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney \"the greatest actor of them all\", and Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, National Velvet and The Human Comedy, said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with.\"Rooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at age six. At age thirteen he played the role Puck in the play and later the film, A Midsummer Night's Dream in an acclaimed performance, which critic David Thomson praised as \"one of cinema's most arresting pieces of magic.\" He co-starred in Boys Town (1938) with Spencer Tracy, who won an Oscar for his role. At nineteen he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar, for his leading role in Babes in Arms, co-starring Judy Garland, and was awarded a special Juvenile Academy Award in 1939.\n\nOverall, between the age of 15 and 25, while at his peak, he made forty-three pictures and co-starred alongside leading actors, including Judy Garland, Wallace Beery, Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor. Rooney developed into one of MGM's most consistently successful actors, and a favorite of studio head, Louis B. Mayer.\n\nHe was the top box office attraction of 1939, but his career never rose to such heights again. He was drafted into the Army during World War II, serving nearly two years entertaining over 2 million troops on stage and on the radio. He was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. After he returned from the war in 1945, too old for juvenile roles but too short to be a movie star, he was not able to obtain acting roles as significant as before. Nevertheless, Rooney was tenacious and he rebounded, his popularity renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), and The Black Stallion (1979), for which he was Oscar nominated. In the early 1980s he returned to Broadway in Sugar Babies and once more was a celebrated star. He also made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs and talk shows. During his career, he received four Academy Award nominations and was nominated for five Emmy Awards, winning one.",

    "biography": "An American actor best known for his work in Bringing Out the Dead, Pulp Fiction, Baby Boy, Don King: Only in America, and the Mission: Impossible film series. Rhames was born in New York City, New York, he entered New York's School of Performing Arts, where he discovered his love of acting. After high school, he studied drama at SUNY Purchase where he met fellow actor Stanley Tucci, who gave him his nickname \"Ving\". He later transferred to Juilliard, where he began his career in New York theater. Rhames first appeared on Broadway in the play The Winter Boys in 1984. Ving continued his rise to fame through his work in soap operas. He found work as a supporting actor, and came to the attention of the general public by playing the role of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction (1994). Rhames was also getting public exposure on television as Peter Benton's brother-in-law on the medical drama ER, a recurring role he filled for 3 seasons. Not long after, Rhames was cast with Tom Cruise as the ace computer hacker Luther Stickell in Brian De Palma's Mission: Impossible (1996). With solid performances in two of these highly popular productions, his face was now known to moviegoers; the work offers began rolling in more frequently and he can been seen in several popular films such as Con Air and Dawn of the Dead.  Rhames won a Golden Globe in 1998 for best actor in a TV miniseries for his performance in HBO's Don King: Only in America. At the ceremony Rhames gave his award to fellow nominee Jack Lemmon (who is White), saying \"I feel that being an artist is about giving, and I'd like to give this to you.\" Lemmon was clearly touched by the gesture as was the celebrity audience who gave Lemmon a standing ovation. Lemmon, who tried unsuccessfully to give the award back to Rhames said it was \"one of the sweetest moments I've ever known in my life.\" The Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced later that they would have a duplicate award prepared for Rhames.",

    "biography": "Peter Greene (born Peter Green; October 8, 1965) is an American character actor.\n\nA native of Montclair, New Jersey, Greene did not pursue a career in acting until his mid 20s. He initially landed several roles in cinema and television in the early 1990s.\n\nGreene's breakthrough came in 1994-1995 with a roles in Pulp Fiction, The Mask, Clean, Shaven, and The Usual Suspects. Greene is possibly best remembered for his role in Pulp Fiction, as Zed who rapes Marsellus Wallace. The Mask saw him play the villainous Dorian Tyrell opposite Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz. Greene's most accomplished role was that of schizophrenic Peter Winter in Clean, Shaven. The Usual Suspects saw him play the small but memorable character, Redfoot. Greene often plays villains such as in Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, Training Day (as a corrupt narcotics officer) and martial arts/crime film Fist of the Warrior (opposite Ho-Sung Pak, Roger Guenveur Smith and Sherilyn Fenn).\n\nHe worked with one director, Jordan Alan, twice. Once on the film Kiss and Tell, a dark comic turn for the actor and then again 4 years later in The Gentleman Bandit (aka Gentleman B). After Greene's arrests in 1998 for drug related crimes, Alan had to put the actor through rehab to get him through the second film and eventually, after coming upon Greene doing heroine with Mike Starr, he was forced to replace Greene's voice because of the vocal problems caused by drugs. Despite these problems, Mr. Alan vouched for Greene to producer Tobe Jaffe for the movie Blue Streak.\n\nHe played Martin Lawrence's nemesis in Blue Streak.\n\nGreene has continued to mostly work as a character actor. He appeared in the short-lived television drama The Black Donnellys. He also appeared as a policeman in Prodigy of Mobb Deep's video for \"A,B,C's\", as well as the focal character in House of Pain's video for \"Fed Up\".\n\nGreene recently appeared in the opening scene of the premier of the new FX series Justified.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Peter Greene, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia\u200b",

He was married to actress Kelly Preston from 1985 to 1987.\n\nGage was born as Kevin Gaede in Wisconsin, where he grew up dividing his time between attending school, working in his grandparents' dairy, and participating in sports. Upon graduating from high school, he hitchhiked his way to Florida, where he saw the ocean for the very first time. He lived and worked there for a time, taking odd jobs to support himself, although ultimately decided to gravitate out west to California. Once in Los Angeles, he was spotted by a theatrical agent and asked if he had ever given any serious thought to becoming an actor. During a subsequent audition, Gage displayed obvious natural abilities, and it was suggested that he enroll in an acting workshop to further develop his talent. He soon came to love the profession, and over time began to find work in playing small parts on series television and low-budget film productions. His breakthrough role eventually came in the DeNiro / Pacino crime epic, Heat, portraying the ominous thrill-killing loose cannon, Waingro. Gage went on from there to give numerous other performances in many films.\n\nOn July 30, 2003, Gage was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison, starting September 29, 2003, for cultivating marijuana despite owning a California-issued license for medicinal marijuana. Gage stated that he cultivated medicinal cannabis to help him cope with chronic pain and stress from injuries suffered in a 1993 car accident, as well as for a sister with cancer and brother with multiple sclerosis. He was released September 21, 2005.\n\nGage was involved in another cannabis-related incident on April 29, 2008 in Annapolis, Maryland. The actor was reportedly arrested for smoking marijuana after police were called to the scene of a loud party. Afterwards, Gage was cited and released on his own recognizance.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kevin Gage (actor), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is a two-time Academy Award winner for his roles in Mystic River (2003) and Milk (2008), as well as the recipient of a Golden Globe Award for the former and a Screen Actors Guild Award for the latter.  Penn began his acting career in television with a brief appearance in a 1974 episode of Little House on the Prairie, directed by his father Leo Penn. Following his film debut in 1981's Taps and a diverse range of film roles in the 1980s, Penn emerged as a prominent leading actor with the 1995 drama film Dead Man Walking, for which he earned his first Academy Award nomination and the Best Actor Award at the Berlin Film Festival.

    "biography": "\u200bThomas Christopher \"Chris\" Parnell (born February 5, 1967) is an American comic actor best known as a cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1998\u20132006 and currently for his recurring role as Dr. Leo Spaceman on NBC's Emmy Award-winning comedy series 30 Rock. Parnell is currently one of the lead voices on the FX animated comedy Archer. In 2010, Parnell starred alongside his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz in the Comedy Central series Big Lake.\n\nAfter performing as a company player with The Groundlings for a number of years, Parnell was hired to join the cast of Saturday Night Live as a featured player on September 26, 1998, and was promoted to repertory player the following season. In the summer of 2001, budget cuts and hiring four new cast members required Lorne Michaels to dismiss two cast members; he chose to lay off Parnell and Jerry Minor over Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, and Maya Rudolph.\n\nWhile on SNL, Parnell appeared in numerous sketches, and commercial parodies, and performed memorable impressions of various celebrities. One of his most popular sketches is Lazy Sunday, a rap video he shot with Andy Samberg about buying cupcakes and going to see The Chronicles of Narnia. He has also performed raps about hosts Jennifer Garner, Britney Spears, Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Lorne Michaels announced that four cast members would be fired due to budget cuts, but he did not say who. On September 22, 2006 it was announced that three cast members had been fired: Parnell, Horatio Sanz, and Finesse Mitchell. This effectively made him the only SNL performer to have been fired twice by Lorne Michaels, though Parnell did say in a 2008 interview with The Sound of Young America podcast that he was okay with being let go this time, because he was considering leaving after that season anyway, but added that he probably would have stayed one last season if he was asked back. He had been with SNL for eight seasons; at the time only four people (Darrell Hammond, Tim Meadows, Kevin Nealon, and Al Franken) have been cast members longer. He has since made uncredited cameo appearances on the show, most recently in 2008 parodying newscasters Tom Brokaw, Jim Lehrer, and Bob Schieffer.\n\nParnell and his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz recently starred together in Big Lake, a 2010 sitcom on Comedy Central from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.\n\nHe also recently appeared as Dr. Drummer/Santa in the SyFy Holiday Special episode from the television show Eureka, which aired on December 7, 2010 (Season 4 Episode 10).",

He appeared in numerous films and television guest roles, and was  nominated for an Academy Award twice (for 1960's Murder, Inc. and 1961's Pocketful of Miracles), and won the Emmy Award on five occasions (four for Columbo) and the Golden Globe award once. Director William Friedkin, when discussing Falk's role in his 1978 film The Brink's Job said that \"Peter has a great range from comedy to drama. He could break your heart or he could make you laugh.\"\n\nIn 1968 he starred with Gene Berry in a ninety-minute TV pilot about a highly-skilled, laid-back detective. Columbo eventually became part of an anthology series entitled, \"The NBC Mystery Movie\", along with \"McCloud\" and \"McMillan And Wife\". The detective series stayed on NBC from 1971-1978, took a five year respite, and returned occasionally on ABC from 1983-2003. He was \"everyone's favorite rumpled television detective\", writes historian David Fantle. Describing his role, Variety columnist Howard Prouty writes, \"The joy of all this is watching Columbo dissemble the fiendishly clever cover stories of the loathsome rats who consider themselves his better.\"",

At the age of 16, he got his first job at Birmingham Repertory Theatre. A year later he received a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. In 1975 he won the Best Actor Bancroft Gold Medal for his stage performance. McNally's most notable stage performances in London's West End include his appearance as Alan Bennett opposite Maggie Smith in 'The Lady in the Van' and opposite Juliette Binoche in 'Naked'. He also starred as Richard in Terry Johnson's 'Dead Funny' at the Savoy Theatre.\n\nSince 1976 McNally has been involved in numerous TV productions beginning with his portrayal of the Roman ruler Castor, son of Tiberius, in the acclaimed BBC history series I, Claudius (1976) and his portrayal of Drake Carne in the popular series Poldark (1975). His career on television ascended after his work in Masada (1981) and in the cult TV series Doctor Who: The Twin Dilemma (1984). During the 1980s and 1990s McNally established himself as a reputable and versatile actor on both the British and American TV. He played a broad variety of leading and supporting characters ranging from the Soviet politician Kirov in Stalin (1992) to homicide detective Jack Taylor in Chiller (1995), and from an insecure son, Alan Hook, in TV series Dad (1997) to a convicted murderer James Hopkin in Bloodlines (2005). His portrayal of Frank Worsley in Shackleton (2002) as well as the role of Harry Woolf in Life on Mars (2006)  are among his best known works for television.  Between 2011 - 2012 he appeared in three episodes of Downton Abbey as Horrace Bryant.\n\nIn 1977 McNally made his big screen debut as HMS Ranger Crewman in the James Bond adventure The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).

    "biography": "Jim \u00a0has proven himself a major talent \u00a0beloved to a wide range of audiences after achieving milestones in stand-up, acting and writing. As approachable as he is edgy, JIm is responsible for some of the funniest and most memorable moment in recent television (primetime,\u2028cable and late-night circuit and film. \u2028\u2028As a stand-up comedian, Gaffigan\u2019s clever, quiet style has earned him an unprecedented number of appearances on both CBS\u2019 LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\u2028and NBC\u2019s LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN. \u00a0His recent one hour Comedy Central Special, CD and DVD, all entitled \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d have catapulted\u2028Gaffigan to one of the most popular touring and recorded comedians in the country today. \u00a0The DVD for \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d went Gold within the first six months. After Gaffigan\u2019s first appearance on DAVID LETTERMAN, the host personally chose him to develop a sitcom for World Wide Pants. \u00a0Eighteen months later, WELCOME\u2028TO NEW YORK debuted on CBS to critical acclaim. \u00a0He then co-starred with Ellen DeGeneres on her CBS sitcom THE ELLEN SHOW. \u00a0For two years he had\u2028recurring roles both on FOX\u2019s THAT 70'S SHOW and NBC\u2019s ED. \u00a0Jim has also had roles on SEX AND THE CITY, THIRD WATCH and each of the LAW &amp; ORDER\u2028shows, among others. Jim can be seen this November in MY BOYS, TBS' first original scripted comedy series. On film, Jim has endeared himself to audiences by taking on vivid supporting characters in a number of genres. \u00a0In the cult hit SUPER TROOPERS, Gaffigan got huge laughs and famously helped add \"meow\" to the lexicon of Vermont state troopers. \u00a0Jim's quiet dramatic turn in THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL, a\u2028meditation on the aftermath of 9/11, took audiences and critics by surprise as he embodied an office worker broken by tragedy who ultimately explodes in rage. Gaffigan\u2019s other recent film credits include the forthcoming independent films THE LIVING WAKE and STEPHANIE DALEY. \u00a0He has also been featured in TRUST THE MAN, 13 GOING ON 30, THREE KINGS, FINAL, IGBY GOES DOWN, ENTROPY and THIRTY YEARS TO\u2028LIFE. \u00a0In 2004, he co-starred in TNT\u2019s BAD APPLE, with Chris Noth. Gaffigan recently signed on to co-write and lend his voice to 20 new episodes\u2028of PALE FORCE, a series of animated shorts that will air regularly on CONAN and on the internet via webisodes starting in October. \u00a0The series focuses on\u2028two pale crime-fighting superheroes that, like Gaffigan and O'Brien, are equipped with fair skin. Many recognize Gaffigan from his numerous award-winning commercial campaigns, which include Sierra Mist, ESPN, Saturn and Rolling Rock. \u00a0His commercial\u2028presence earned him Business Week\u2019s 1999 \"Salesman of the Year\"honor. Gaffigan currently lives in New York with his family.",

    "biography": "Goldie Jeanne Hawn (born November 21, 1945) is an American actress, film director, producer, and occasional singer. Goldie Hawn has been a Hollywood comedy star since her big hit in 1980, Private Benjamin. She started as a dancer, first in New York and then in Los Angeles. On the cast of TV's Laugh-In, the mod comedy show of the late 1960s, she flubbed jokes in a bikini and became one of the show's most popular co-stars. Hawn then proved the ding-a-ling act was just an act -- she won an Oscar for a supporting role in Cactus Flower (1969, with Walter Matthau) and turned in a solid performance in Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express (1974). She had one blockbuster, Private Benjamin, and has since had a steady career as a leading lady in hits and misses, often acting as her own producer. Her movies include 'Shampoo' (1975, starring Warren Beatty), 'Death Becomes Her' (1992, with Bruce Willis), 'The First Wives Club' (1996, with Diane Keaton) and 'The Banger Sisters' (2002, with Susan Sarandon). She is the longtime girlfriend of actor Kurt Russell and the mother of actress Kate Hudson.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Goldie Hawn, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Barbara Hershey (born Barbara Lynn Herzstein; February 5, 1948),\u00a0 also known as Barbara Seagull,\u00a0 is an American actress. In a career spanning nearly 50 years, she has played a variety of roles on television and in cinema, in several genres including westerns and comedies. Although she began acting at age 17 in 1965, Hershey did not achieve much critical acclaim until the latter half of the 1980s. By that time, the Chicago Tribune referred to her as \"one of America's finest actresses.\" Hershey was awarded an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actress In A Miniseries/TV Film for her role in A Killing in a Small Town (1990). She has been nominated for two more Golden Globes: in 1989 for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mary Magdalene in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, and for her role in Jane Campion's Portrait of a Lady (1996). For the latter film, she was also nominated for an Academy Award and she won a Los Angeles Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress. In addition, she has won two Best Actress awards at the Cannes Film Festival for her roles in Shy People (1987) and A World Apart (1988). She also featured in both Woody Allen's critically acclaimed Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and Garry Marshall's comedy, Beaches (1988).\n\nEstablishing a reputation early in her career as a \"hippie\", Hershey experienced conflict between her personal life and her acting goals. Her career suffered a decline during a six year relationship with actor David Carradine, with whom she had a child. She experimented with a change in stage name that she later regretted. During this time her personal life was highly publicized and ridiculed.\u00a0 It was not until she separated from Carradine and changed her stage name back to Hershey that her acting career became well established.\u00a0 Later in her career, she began to keep her personal life private.\u00a0 Her career was again revived by the release of Black Swan, for which her portrayal of an overbearing mother and former ballerina has received critical acclaim and a BAFTA Award nomination.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Barbara Hershey, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Wesley Trent Snipes (born July 31, 1962) is an American actor, film producer, and martial artist. He has starred in numerous action-adventures, thrillers, and dramatic feature films and is well-known for his role as Blade in the Blade trilogy. Snipes formed a production company titled Amen-Ra Films in 1991 and a subsidiary, Black Dot Media, to develop projects for film and television. Snipes has been training in martial arts since age twelve, earning a high ranking 5th dan black belt in Shotokan Karate and 2nd dan black belt in Hapkido. He has also trained as a student of Capoeira under Mestre Jelon Vieira and in a number of other disciplines including various styles of kung fu. At age 23, Snipes was discovered by an agent while performing in a competition. He made his film debut in the 1986 Goldie Hawn vehicle Wildcats. Later that year, he appeared on the trendy 1980's TV show Miami Vice as a drug-dealing pimp in the episode 'Streetwise' (first aired December 5, 1986). In 1987, he appeared as Michael Jackson's nemesis in the Martin Scorsese-directed music video \"Bad\" (he is seen in only the long version of the video) and the feature film Streets of Gold. That same year, Snipes was also considered for the role of Geordi La Forge in the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation. Snipes' performance in the music video \"Bad\" caught the eye of director Spike Lee. Snipes turned down a small role in Lee's Do the Right Thing for the larger part of Willie Mays Hayes in Major League, beginning a succession of box-office hits for Snipes. Lee would later cast Snipes as the jazz saxophonist Shadow Henderson in Mo' Better Blues and as the lead in the interracial romantic drama Jungle Fever. Another important role for Snipes was the powerful drug lord Nino Brown in New Jack City, which was written specifically for him by Barry Michael Cooper. Another film in which his character was involved in drugs was the somber movie Sugar Hill. Although Snipes is more known for his roles in action films like Passenger 57, Demolition Man (with Sylvester Stallone), Money Train, U.S. Marshals (a sequel of The Fugitive) and Rising Sun (with Sean Connery), he has also had success in comedies like White Men Can't Jump, and To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar where he played a drag queen together with Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo. Snipes has also been critically acclaimed for his roles in dramas like The Waterdance and Disappearing Acts. Snipes has been married twice; first, to April Snipes from 1985-1990 with whom he has a son, Jelani Asar Snipes, born in 1988. Jelani had a cameo role in Snipes' 1990 film Mo' Better Blues. In 2003, Snipes wed painter Nakyung 'Nikki' Park, who is the mother of his four youngest children: son Akhenaten Kihwa-T Snipes; daughter Iset Jua-T Snipes (born July 31, 2001); son Alaafia Jehu-T Snipes (born May 26, 2004); and son Alimayu Moa-T Snipes (born March 26, 2007). Snipes spends a lot of time in Park's home country of South Korea, which he calls his \"second home.\" \u00a0",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJames Nesbitt (born 15 January 1965) is a Northern Irish actor. Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, Nesbitt grew up in the nearby village of Broughshane, before moving to Coleraine, County Londonderry. He wanted to become a teacher, like his father, so began a degree in French at the University of Ulster. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical Up on the Roof (1987, 1989) to the political drama Paddywack (1994). He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O'Donnell in Hear My Song (1991).\n\nNesbitt got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama Cold Feet (1998\u20132003), which won him a British Comedy Award, a Television and Radio Industries Club Award, and a National Television Award. His first significant film role came when he appeared as pig farmer \"Pig\" Finn in Waking Ned (1998). With the rest of the starring cast, Nesbitt was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. In Lucky Break (2001), he made his debut as a film lead playing prisoner Jimmy Hands. The next year, he played Ivan Cooper in the television film Bloody Sunday, about the 1972 shootings in Derry. A departure from his previous \"cheeky chappie\" roles, the film was a turning point in his career. He won a British Independent Film Award and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.\n\nNesbitt has also starred in Murphy's Law (2001\u20132007) as undercover detective Tommy Murphy\u2014a role that was created for him by writer Colin Bateman. The role twice gained Nesbitt Best Actor nominations at the Irish Film &amp; Television Awards (IFTA). In 2007, he starred in the dual role of Tom Jackman and Mr Hyde in Steven Moffat's Jekyll, which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination in 2008. Nesbitt has since appeared in several more dramatic roles; he starred alongside Liam Neeson in Five Minutes of Heaven (2009), and was one of three lead actors in the television miniseries Occupation (2009) and The Deep (2010). He also starred in the movies Outcast (2010) and Emilio Estevez's The Way (2011), and has been cast in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit (2012/13).\n\nNesbitt is married to former actress Sonia Forbes-Adam, with whom he has two daughters. He is a patron of numerous charities and in 2010 accepted the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article James Nesbitt, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

    "biography": "Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, KBE (13 August 1899 \u2013 29 April 1980) was an English director and producer. He pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both silent films and early talkies, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood. In 1956 he became an American citizen while remaining a British subject.\n\nOver a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside \"icy blonde\" female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys or \"MacGuffins\" meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents, he became a cultural icon.\n\nHitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's Daily Telegraph, which said: \"Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.\" The magazine MovieMaker has described him as the most influential filmmaker of all-time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema's most significant artists.",

Kani joined The Serpent Players (a group of actors whose first performance was in the former snake pit of the zoo, hence the name) in Port Elizabeth in 1965 and helped to create many plays that went unpublished but were performed to a resounding reception. These were followed by the more famous Sizwe Banzi is Dead and The Island, co-written with Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona, in the early 1970s. He also received an Olivier nomination for his role in My Children My Africa! Kani's work has been widely performed around the world, including New York, where he and Winston Ntshona won a Tony Award in 1975 for Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island. These two plays were presented in repertory at the Edison Theatre for a total of 52 performances. Nothing but the Truth (2002) was his debut as sole playwright and was first performed in the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. This play takes place in post-apartheid South Africa and does not concern the conflicts between whites and blacks, but the rift between blacks who stayed in South Africa to fight apartheid, and those who left only to return when the hated regime folded. It won the 2003 Fleur du Cap Awards for best actor and best new South African play. In the same year he was also awarded a special Obie award for his extraordinary contribution to theatre in the USA. Kani is executive trustee of the Market Theatre Foundation, founder and director of the Market Theatre Laboratory and chairman of the National Arts Council of SA.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Kani, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

While still in the wrestling game, Roach broke into acting with a bit part in the\u00a0Stanley Kubrick\n\n\u00a0filmBarry Lyndon\u00a0(1975). He quickly became popular as an enforcer or warrior figure and appeared on-screen with some of Hollywood's biggest names. Many people would remember him as the muscle-bound, bald German guard who hands out a beating toHarrison Ford\u00a0in\u00a0Les aventuriers de l'arche perdue\u00a0(1981), before being cut down by a spinning plane propeller.\n\nIn other film roles, Roach nearly eliminates 007\u00a0Sean Connery\n\n\u00a0in the Bond film\u00a0Jamais plus jamais\u00a0(1983), in dual roles as a resurrected demon and as a fierce warrior, he fought\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0in the Conan sequel\u00a0Conan le destructeur\u00a0(1984), and was back as a ferocious Indian guard pummeling poor\u00a0Harrison Ford\u00a0once again inIndiana Jones et le temple maudit\u00a0(1984), before falling into a rock crusher.\n\nHe also appeared in\u00a0Indiana Jones et la derni\u00e8re croisade\n\n\u00a0(1989),\u00a0Kalidor - la l\u00e9gende du talisman\u00a0(1985) and\u00a0Robin des bois: Prince des voleurs\u00a0(1991).

    "biography": "Dennis Lee Hopper (May 17, 1936 \u2013 May 29, 2010) was an American actor, filmmaker and artist. As a young man, Hopper became interested in acting and eventually became a student of the Actors' Studio. He made his first television appearance in 1954, and appeared in two films featuring James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956). During the next 10 years, Hopper appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and by the end of the 1960s had played supporting roles in several films. He directed and starred in Easy Rider (1969), winning an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as co-writer. \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion.\" Film critic Matthew Hays notes that \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper.\" He was unable to build on his success for several years, until a featured role in Apocalypse Now (1979) brought him attention. He subsequently appeared in Rumble Fish (1983) and The Osterman Weekend (1983), and received critical recognition for his work in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers, with the latter film garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He directed Colors (1988) and played the villain in Speed (1994). Hopper's later work included a leading role in the television series Crash. Hopper's last performance was filmed just before his death: The Last Film Festival, slated for a 2011 release. Hopper was also a prolific and acclaimed photographer, a profession he began in the 1960s.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Dennis Hopper, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Until 1934, he worked as a theatre actor. Wolfe mostly found work as a character actor, appearing in over 270 films. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had two daughters.\n\nWolfe was also a veteran of World War I where he served as a medical sergeant in the National Army of the United States. His service number was 2371377.\n\nAlthough American by birth and upbringing, Wolfe was often cast as an Englishman: his stage experience endowed him with precise diction resembling an upper-class British accent. A receding hairline and etched features at a relatively early age allowed him to play older men before he actually grew old. Wolfe found a niche as a soft-spoken learned man, and his over 250 roles included many attorneys, judges, butlers, ministers, professors, and doctors.\n\nWolfe's best-known role may have been in the 1946 movie Bedlam, in which he played a scientist confined to an asylum.\n\nWolfe wrote and self-published two books of poetry Forty-Four Scribbles and a Prayer: Lyrics and Ballads and Sixty Ballads and Lyrics In Search of Music.\n\nOf note to science fiction fans, Ian Wolfe appeared in two episodes of the original Star Trek television series: \"Bread and Circuses\" (1968) as Septimus, and \"All Our Yesterdays\" (1969) as Mr. Atoz, and portrayed the wizard Traquil in the cult series Wizards and Warriors.\n\nIn 1982, Wolfe had a small recurring role on the TV series WKRP in Cincinnati as Hirsch, the sarcastic, irreverent butler to WKRP owner Lillian Carlson.\n\nWolfe, who worked until the last couple of years of his life, died January 23, 1992, at age 95, of natural causes. He was cremated.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ian Wolfe, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "One-of-a-kind nightclub comedian/singer Dick Shawn (ne Richard  Schulefand) was as off-the-wall as they came and, as such, proved to be  rather an acquired taste. Way ahead of his time most say, it was  extremely difficult indeed to know how to properly tap into this man's  eclectic talents. Shawn began inching toward the forefront during the  be-bop 50s and early 60s with his odd penchant for playing cool  cats.During his mild bid for film stardom, he was top-billed as a hip,  laid back genie in the thoroughly dismal satire The Wizard of Baghdad  (1960), but seemed to have better luck when taken in smaller doses. He  fared quite well opposite another \"way-out-there\" comedian, Ernie  Kovacs, in Wake Me When It's Over (1960) as a hustling soldier out to  make a buck in the Far East. Also on the plus side, he replaced Zero  Mostel in the bawdy musical \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the  Forum\" on Broadway and stole a small scene in the all-star epic comedy  It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963). By far, the one role that  completely overshadows all of his other hard work is his mock portrayal  of a singing Adolf Hitler in the show-within-a-movie The Producers  (1968). In the film, which starred Mostel and Gene Wilder as two con  artists deliberately producing a stage \"bomb\" called \"Springtime for  Hitler,\" Shawn sang the hammy, absurdly narcissistic song \"Love Power.\"  The movie finally captured Shawn in his element, but this stroke of  genius of matching actor to role would never happen again for him. For  the most part his roles came off slick and smarmy, and were stuck in  mediocre material.Shawn won a huge fan base, however, touring in one-man  stage shows which contained a weird mix of songs, sketches, satire,  philosophy and even pantomime. A bright, innovative wit, one of his best  touring shows was called \"The Second Greatest Entertainer in the  World.\" During the show's intermission, Shawn would lie visibly on the  stage floor absolutely still during the entire time. By freakish  coincidence, Shawn was performing at the University of California at San  Diego in 1987 when he suddenly fell forward on the stage during one of  his spiels about the Holocaust. The audience, of course, laughed,  thinking it was just a part of his odd shtick. In actuality, the  63-year-old married actor with four children had suffered a fatal heart  attack. A not surprising end for this thoroughly offbeat and intriguing  personality.",

Educated in Great Britain, Love began his career as an artist and military correspondent with his first important job as a London newspaper cartoonist. Love honed basic stage talents in London, and in 1913 sailed to the Canada and crossed the border into the United States in November with a road-company production of Cyril Maude's Grumpy.\n\nUsually Love was cast in heartless villain roles. In the 1920s, he played with Rudolph Valentino in The Son of the Sheik, opposite John Barrymore in Don Juan, and appeared with Lillian Gish in 1928's The Wind. He also portrayed 'Colonel Ibbetson' in Forever (1921), the silent film version of Peter Ibbetson. Love was one of the more successful villains in silent films.\n\nOne of Love's first sound films was the part-talkie The Mysterious Island co-starring Lionel Barrymore. In 1937, he played Henry VIII in the first talking film version of Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, with Errol Flynn. Love played the bigoted Bishop of the Black Canons in The Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Flynn, too. However, he also played gruff authoritarian figures, such as Monsieur Cavaignac, who, contrary to history, demands the resignation of those responsible for the Dreyfus coverup, in The Life of Emile Zola (1937), as well as Don Alejandro de la Vega, whose son appears to be a fop but is actually Zorro, in the 1940 version of The Mark of Zorro, starring Tyrone Power.\n\nIn 1941, he played a doctor in Shining Victory, which also starred James Stephenson, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Crisp. In 1939's Gunga Din, it is Montagu Love who reads the final stanza of Rudyard Kipling's original poem over the body of the slain Din.\n\nLove's last film to be released, Devotion, was released three years after his death aged 63 in 1943. He was interred at Chapel of the Pines Crematory. His last acting stint was on Wings Over the Pacific (1943).",

In 1939, Watson delivered a fine, tear-jerking performance as Pud, Lionel Barrymore's grandson, in the MGM film, On Borrowed Time. Watson later made guest appearances in many television programs, including The Twilight Zone, Lou Grant, The Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres, and The Fugitive.\n\nIn addition to working in the motion pictures business, Watson went to Claremont School of Theology to become a Methodist minister, inspired from the movie Boys Town.

Waits has a distinctive voice, described by critic Daniel Durchholz as sounding \"like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car.\" With this trademark growl, his incorporation of pre-rock music styles such as blues, jazz, and vaudeville, and experimental tendencies verging on industrial music, Waits has built up a distinctive musical persona. He has worked as a composer for movies and musical plays and as a supporting actor in films, including Down By Law, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Wristcutters: A Love Story. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his soundtrack work on One from the Heart.\n\nLyrically, Waits' songs frequently present atmospheric portrayals of grotesque, often seedy characters and places \u2013 although he has also shown a penchant for more conventional ballads. He has a cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters despite having little radio or music video support. His songs are best-known to the general public in the form of cover versions by more visible artists: \"Jersey Girl\", performed by Bruce Springsteen, \"Ol' 55\", performed by the Eagles, and \"Downtown Train\", performed by Rod Stewart. Although Waits' albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries. He has been nominated for a number of major music awards and has won Grammy Awards for two albums, Bone Machine and Mule Variations. In 2010, Waits was chosen to be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nWaits currently lives in Sonoma County, California with his wife, Kathleen Brennan, and three children.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Tom Waits, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He has enjoyed success in music, television and film.\u00a0In April 2007, Newsweek called him the most powerful actor on the planet. Smith has been nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won multiple Grammy Awards.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for nearly six years (1990\u20131996) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Smith transitioned from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films that received broad box office success. In fact, he is the only actor in history to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office as well as being the only actor to have eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the #1 spot in the domestic box office tally. Fourteen of the 19 fiction films he has acted in have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million, and 4 of them took in over $500 million in global box office receipts. His most financially successful films have been Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, Independence Day, Men in Black, Men in Black II, I, Robot, The Pursuit of Happyness, I Am Legend, Hancock, Wild Wild West, Enemy of the State, Shark Tale, Hitch, and Seven Pounds. He also earned critical praise for his performances in Six Degrees of Separation, Ali, and The Pursuit of Happyness, receiving Best Actor Oscar nominations for the latter two.

    "biography": "Seth Rogen (born April 15, 1982) is a Canadian actor, comedian, voice artist, screenwriter, and film producer. Rogen began his career doing stand-up comedy for four years during his teens, coming in second place in the Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest in 1998. While still living in his native Vancouver, he landed a supporting role in Freaks and Geeks. Shortly after Rogen moved to Los Angeles for his role, Freaks and Geeks was canceled after one season due to poor ratings. He then got a part on the equally short-lived Undeclared, which also hired him as a staff writer. After landing a job as a staff writer on the final season of Da Ali G Show, for which Rogen and the other writers received an Emmy nomination, he was guided by film producer Judd Apatow toward a film career. Rogen was cast in a major supporting role and credited as a co-producer in Apatow's directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\u00a0\n\nAfter receiving critical praise for that performance, Universal Pictures agreed to cast him as the lead in Apatow's next directorial feature, Knocked Up.\n\nRogen has appeared in the films Donnie Darko, You, Me and Dupree, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Observe and Report, and The Green Hornet, and also in the Apatow-produced comedies The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express, and Funny People. He and his comedy partner Evan Goldberg co-wrote the comedy films Superbad and Pineapple Express, for which he originally intended to headline while in high school. Rogen has provided voice talents in the animated films Horton Hears a Who!, Kung Fu Panda, and Monsters vs. Aliens. He also supports Crowdrise, a charitable networking site.",

    "biography": "Adam Sandler was born on September 9, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York, to Judy and Stanley Sandler. At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family's friend Smitty on \"The Cosby Show\" (1984). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was \"discovered\" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975) producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. After \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975), Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Airheads (1994), Happy Gilmore (1996), Billy Madison (1995) and Big Daddy (1999/I). He has also starred in Mr. Deeds (2002) alongside Winona Ryder; Eight Crazy Nights (2002), an animated movie about the Jewish festival of Chanukah; and Punch-Drunk Love (2002). He also writes and produces many of his own films and has composed songs for several of them, including The Wedding Singer (1998). Sandler has had several of his songs placed on the \"Billboard\" charts, including the classic \"The Chanukah Song\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Adam Sandler, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "An American actor, producer and director. He has performed in leading roles in a variety of films, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action movies. Cage is known for his prolificacy, appearing in at least one film per year, nearly every year since 1980 (with the exception of 1985 and 1991).\n\nIn the early years of his career, Cage starred in critically acclaimed films such as Valley Girl (1983), Racing with the Moon (1984), Birdy (1985), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), Raising Arizona (1987), Moonstruck (1987), Vampire's Kiss (1989), Wild at Heart (1990), Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), and Red Rock West (1993). Cage received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance as an alcoholic Hollywood writer in Leaving Las Vegas (1995) before coming to the attention of wider audiences with mainstream films such as The Rock (1996), Face/Off (1997), Con Air (1997), City of Angels (1998) and National Treasure (2004). He earned his second Academy Award nomination for his performance as Charlie and Donald Kaufman in Adaptation (2002). In 2002, he directed the film Sonny for which he was nominated for Grand Special Prize at Deauville Film Festival.  Cage owns a production company, Saturn Films, and produced films such as Shadow of the Vampire (2000) and The Life of David Gale (2003).\n\nThough his performances in The Weather Man (2005), Lord of War (2005), The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), and Kick-Ass (2010) earned critical acclaim, and films such as Ghost Rider (2007) and Knowing (2009) were box office successes, Cage has been strongly criticized in recent years for his choice of roles, some of which have been universally panned. Most recently, he voiced the character of Grug in the animated film The Croods.\n\nHe was born Nicolas Kim Coppola on January 7, 1964, in Long Beach, California, to parents August Floyd Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy (Vogelsang), a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family. His father was of Italian descent and his mother is of German and Polish descent. His paternal grandparents were composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino, and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda, Basilicata, Italy. Through his father, Cage is the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola and of actress Talia Shire, and the cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola, and actors Robert Carmine and Jason Schwartzman. Cage's two brothers are New York radio personality Marc \"The Cope\" Coppola and director Christopher Coppola.\n\nHe attended Beverly Hills High School, which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of Golden Boy.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Nicolas Cage, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \u00a0\n\nHans Walter Conrad Veidt (22 January 1893 \u2013 3 April 1943) was a German actor best remembered for his roles in films such as Different from the Others (1919), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and The Man Who Laughs (1928). After a successful career in German silent film, where he was one of the best-paid stars of Ufa, he was forced to leave Germany in 1933 with his new Jewish wife after the Nazis came to power. They settled in Britain, where he participated in a number of films, including The Thief of Bagdad (1940), before emigrating to the United States around 1941, which lead to him having a supporting role in Casablanca (1942).\n\nFrom 1916 until his death, Veidt appeared in more than 100 films. One of his earliest performances was as the murderous somnambulist Cesare in director Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), a classic of German Expressionist cinema, with Werner Krauss and Lil Dagover. His starring role in The Man Who Laughs (1928), as a disfigured circus performer whose face is cut into a permanent grin, provided the (visual) inspiration for the Batman villain the Joker, created in 1940 by Bill Finger. Veidt also starred in other silent horror films such as The Hands of Orlac (1924), another film directed by Robert Wiene, The Student of Prague (1926) and Waxworks (1924) where he played Ivan the Terrible.\n\nVeidt also appeared in Magnus Hirschfeld's film Anders als die Andern (Different from the Others, 1919), one of the first films to sympathetically portray homosexuality, although the characters in it do not end up happily. He had a leading role in Germany's first talking picture, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women, 1929).\n\nHe moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s and made a few films, but the advent of talking pictures and his difficulty with speaking English led him to return to Germany. During this period he lent his expertise to tutoring aspiring performers, one of whom was the later American character actress Lisa Golm.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Conrad Veidt\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He starred in the television series\u00a0Banshee, which airs on HBO-owned\u00a0Cinemax.\u00a0  Starr began his professional acting career early in the 1990s with a small part in\u00a0Shortland Street\u00a0and guest roles in\u00a0Xena: Warrior Princess\u00a0and\u00a0Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.  In 2001, Starr was cast in\u00a0Mercy Peak\u00a0as Todd Van der Velter, one of the no-good, white trash Van der Velter brothers. It was a guest role that he had throughout the show\u2019s three seasons. He also received a role as the brother of long running character\u00a0Waverley Wilson\u00a0in the\u00a0soap opera\u00a0Shortland Street. He appeared for several weeks as part of the write out of the\u00a0Minnie Crozier\u00a0character. Starr did not like the fast pace of the show and thought his performances suffered due to it.  Since then, Starr's television credits have included a core cast role in kids' series\u00a0Hard Out\u00a0and guest roles in\u00a0P.E.T. Detectives\u00a0and\u00a0Street Legal\u00a0as well as a brief stint in\u00a0Serial Killers, the critically acclaimed comedy series that was penned by\u00a0Outrageous Fortune\u00a0co-creator James Griffin.

Readers of the TV Guide also voted Starr Best Actor in the 2007 TV Guide Best on the Box People\u2019s Choice Awards. In 2005, he was named Best Actor at the inaugural Qantas Television Awards for his role in\u00a0Outrageous Fortune.  During the production of the first series of\u00a0Outrageous Fortune, Starr also juggled filming for Toa Fraser's debut feature,\u00a0No. 2\u00a0which was released in New Zealand in early 2006. Starr\u2019s other film credits include\u00a0Roger Donaldson\u2019s\u00a0The World's Fastest Indian, the US comedy feature\u00a0Without a Paddle\u00a0and\u00a0Brad McGann's acclaimed feature film\u00a0In My Father's Den. In the summer of 2006/7 between series two and three of\u00a0Outrageous Fortune, Starr worked on a collaborative short film with some friends.  Starr appeared on stage in the second edition of\u00a0Sex with Strangers\u00a0(2005). In 2004, Starr performed in two theatre productions:\u00a0Closer\u00a0at Auckland's Silo Theatre and\u00a0Sex with Strangers\u00a0directed by Colin Mitchell at the Herald Theatre.

Vienna\". She was a regular panelist on the original version of I've Got a Secret and an occasional panelist on What's My Line?, the latter alongside husband Steve Allen. She also appeared on the NBC interview program Here's Hollywood. During the early days of the burgeoning live entertainment scene in Las Vegas, the Allens occasionally worked together as an act.\n\nPrior to Allen's death in 2000, the couple made several television appearances together; in 1998 they played an argumentative elderly couple in an episode of Homicide: Life on the Street in which Allen's character accidentally shoots a man in the act of committing suicide by plunging from the roof of the elderly couple's building. In 1999, the couple made their last joint TV appearance (again playing a couple) in the all-star episode of the Dick Van Dyke series Diagnosis: Murder, titled \"The Roast\", which marked Steve Allen's final screen appearance. She also appeared in City Slickers (as the telephone voice of Billy Crystal's character's over-protective and oversolicitous mother).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jayne Meadows, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "American film actress Diane Keaton (Born Diane Hall), began her career on stage and got her first major role in the Broadway rock musical \"Hair\" as understudy to the lead. Keaton made her film debut in the 1972 screen adaptation of Woody Allen\u2019s Broadway play \"Play It Again, Sam\". That same year Keaton was cast in her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in the Oscar-winning movie \u201cThe Godfather\u201d. Keaton established herself as a comic actor in her next two films \u201cSleeper\u201d (1973) and \u201cLove and Death\u201d (1975).\n\nIn 1977, Keaton veered away from her comedic image to appear in the remarkable \u201cLooking for Mr. Goodbar\u201d, which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was that same year that she appeared in the title role of \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d, which many consider to be her best performance. The following year Keaton was awarded the Oscar for best actress in a leading role, as well as the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Film Award. In the early 1990\u2019s Keaton began to play more mature roles, though she reprised the role of Kay Adams-Corleone in the third \"Godfather\" epic, The Godfather: Part III (1990). She appeared in the well-liked \u00a0\u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (1991) and \u201cFather of the Bride Part II\u201d (1995) as \u201cNina Banks\u201d the wife of \u201cGeorge Banks\u201d played by Steve Martin. Some of her popular later films include: The First Wives Club (1996), Something's Gotta Give (2003) and The Family Stone (2005). In addition to acting, she is also a director, producer, screenwriter, photographer, real estate developer, and occasional singer. Her first record was an original cast recording of Hair, in 1971. In 1977, she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished product was never seen. In 1995 she received high marks for Unstrung Heroes (1995), her first major feature as a director. Keaton was romantically involved with several other celebrities such as Warren Beatty, Al Pacino and her most famous romance - Woody Allen. In 2001 Keaton publicly announced that she was giving up on pursuing romance and later adopted two children, a daughter, Dexter (adopted 1996), and a son, Duke (adopted 2001).\u00a0",

    "biography": "He was born in Puerto Rico 1959. Calderon moved to New York with his family at the age of six, where he grew up on the streets of the Lower East Side and Spanish Harlem. Following some time in college, he enlisted in the United States Army and served overseas as an infantryman.  Returning to the States, Calderon set his sights on an acting career. Starting out on the New York stage, he won an Obie Award for his performance in Blade to the Heat at the Public Theatre. His most notable Broadway role was opposite Robert De Niro in Cuba and His Teddy Bear. Calderon also appeared off-Broadway in such plays as Requiem For A Heavyweight and Divine Horsemen, and played Achilles in the New York Shakespeare Festival\u2019s production of Troilus and Cressida in Central Park. He is a founding member of the Touchstone Theatre, the American Folk Theatre and the Labyrinth Theatre Company.\n\nCalderon was originally slated to portray the role of Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction; Samuel L. Jackson was subsequently given the role.\n\nCorrection Samuel Jackson told Tarantino he had messed up by not casting him in Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino agreed and told him he was writing a script and had a character that he had written specifically with Jackson in mind. Calderon had a better initial reading than Jackson and Tarantino gave serious consideration to casting him as Jules Winnfield.\n\nCalderon portrays Paul the bartender in dialogue scene between Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace.\n\nCalderon also co-wrote Abel Ferrara's 1992 crime drama Bad Lieutenant, starring Harvey Keitel.\n\nCalderon acted in The Last Castle and the critically acclaimed independent feature Girlfight. His more than three dozen film credits also include Out of Sight, Cop Land, Four Rooms, Pulp Fiction, Bad Lieutenant, The Firm, The Addiction, Q &amp; A, Sea of Love, Clockers and King of New York. In addition, he has made numerous guest appearances on television series, including recurring roles on Dream Street, Law &amp; Order and Miami Vice.\n\nIn 2010, Calderon is set to star as The Businessman in Sanzhar Sultanov's crime drama - The Story.",

    "biography": "Megan Denise Fox\u00a0\u00a0(born May 16, 1986) is an American actress and model. She began her acting career in 2001, with several minor television and film roles, and played a regular role on the Hope &amp; Faith television show. In 2004, she made her film debut with a role in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. In 2007, she co-starred as Mikaela Banes, the love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character, in the blockbuster film, Transformers, which became her breakout role. Fox reprised her role in the 2009 sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Later in 2009, she starred as the eponymous lead in the film Jennifer's Body. Fox is also considered one of the modern female sex symbols and has appeared in magazines such as Maxim, Rolling Stone and FHM.\n\nFox was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the daughter of Gloria Darlene (n\u00e9e Cisson) and Franklin Thomas Fox. She has English, and smaller amounts of Scottish, German, French, Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), and Powhatan Native American, ancestry.She was raised \"very strictly Pentecostal\", but later attended Catholic school for twelve years. Fox's parents divorced when she was young. Fox's mother later remarried, and she and her sister were raised by her mother and her stepfather, Tony Tonachio. She said that the two were \"very strict\" and that she was not allowed to have a boyfriend or invite friends to her house. She lived with her mother until she made enough money to support herself.\n\nFox began her training in drama and dance at age five, in Kingston, Tennessee. She attended a dance class at the community center there and was involved in Kingston Elementary School's chorus and the Kingston Clippers swim team. At 10 years of age, after moving to St. Petersburg, Florida, Fox continued her training. When she was 13 years old, Fox began modeling after winning several awards at the 1999 American Modeling and Talent Convention in Hilton Head, South Carolina. At age 17, she tested out of school via correspondence in order to move to Los Angeles, California.\n\nFox has spoken extensively of her time in education; that in middle school she was bullied and picked on and she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being \"pelted with ketchup packets\". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had \"always gotten along better with boys\" and that \"rubbed some people the wrong way\". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that \"everyone hated me, and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn\u2019t like me for that. I\u2019ve had only one great girlfriend my whole life\". In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has never been \"a big believer in formal education\" and that \"the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So, I was sort of checked out on that part of it\". Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.",

His movies have also earned more than $2.4 billion from 25 theatrical releases worldwide. Grant achieved international stardom after appearing in Richard Curtis's sleeper hit Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). He used this breakthrough role as a frequent cinematic persona during the 1990s to deliver comic performances in mainstream films like Mickey Blue Eyes (1999) and Notting Hill (1999). By the turn of the century, he had established himself as a leading man skilled with a satirical comic talent. Since the 2000s, Grant has expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About A Boy (2002), Love Actually (2003), and American Dreamz (2006).\n\nWithin the film industry, Grant is cited as an anti-movie star who approaches his roles like a character actor, with the ability to make acting look effortless. Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms as well as his precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as a thespian. He has been vocal about his disrespect for the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and hostility towards the media. In a career spanning 20 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting is not a true calling but just a job he fell into.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Hugh Grant, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

The television station replaced him with Ted Casablanca. Before that, he was a news anchor for station WAVE-TV in Louisville, Kentucky and WOTV (now WOOD-TV) in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nIn 1999, Kmetko gave an official \"coming out\" interview to The Advocate's Editor In Chief, Judy Wieder, citing as his reason for doing it: \"It's like what Nathan Lane told you when he came out in The Advocate. It's about what happened to Matthew Shepard. By making this simple statement, maybe people will think twice about other gay people they encounter. Hopefully they'll look at me and say, 'Well, he's succeeded and come out and has a pretty good life.\"\n\nAfter his interview with The Advocate, Kmetko hosted the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association's Excellence in Journalism Awards on October 4, 2005, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, California. In May 2007, Kmetko went on the air as a general assignment reporter for Los Angeles's KTTV Fox 11 News.\n\nKmetko now trains celebrities on the art of being interviewed.

    "biography": "Ruth Elizabeth \"Bette\" Davis (April 5, 1908 \u2013 October 6, 1989) was an American actress of film, television and theater. Noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic characters, she was highly regarded for her performances in a range of film genres; from contemporary crime melodramas to historical and period films and occasional comedies, though her greatest successes were her roles in romantic dramas.\n\nAfter appearing in Broadway plays, Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930, but her early films for Universal Studios were unsuccessful. She joined Warner Bros. in 1932 and established her career with several critically acclaimed performances. In 1937, she attempted to free herself from her contract and although she lost a well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career. Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema's most celebrated leading ladies, known for her forceful and intense style. Davis gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and confrontations with studio executives, film directors and costars were often reported. Her forthright manner, clipped vocal style and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated and satirized.\n\nDavis was the co-founder of the Hollywood Canteen, and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, was the first person to accrue 10 Academy Award nominations for acting, and was the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. Her career went through several periods of eclipse, and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. Married four times, she was once widowed and thrice divorced, and raised her children as a single parent. Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health, but she continued acting until shortly before her death from breast cancer, with more than 100 films, television and theater roles to her credit. In 1999, Davis was placed second, after Katharine Hepburn, on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female stars of all time.",

    "biography": "\u200bSteve Austin (born Steven James Anderson; December 18, 1964, later and formerly Steven James Williams), better known by his ring name \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, is an American film and television actor and retired professional wrestler currently signed to WWE. Austin wrestled for several well-known wrestling promotions such as World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and most famously, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which later became World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002. Billed as \"The Most Popular Superstar in WWE History\", he gained significant mainstream popularity in the WWF during the mid-to-late 1990s as \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, a disrespectful, beer-drinking antihero who routinely defied his boss, Vince McMahon. This defiance was often shown by Austin flipping off McMahon and incapacitating him with the Stone Cold Stunner, his finishing move. McMahon inducted Austin into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009. Austin held nineteen championships throughout his professional wrestling career, and is recognized by WWE as a six-time world champion, having held the WWF Championship on six occasions, and the fifth Triple Crown Champion. He was also the winner of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament, as well as the 1997, 1998 and 2001 Royal Rumbles. He was forced to retire from in ring competition in early 2003 due to a series of knee and neck injuries sustained throughout his career. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, he was featured as the Co-General Manager and \"Sheriff\" of Raw. Since 2005, he has continued to make occasional appearances. In 2011, Steve Austin returned to WWE to host the reality series Tough Enough.  On August 14, 2002, Austin was arrested and charged with domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest on November 25, 2002, and was given a year's probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service.] Marshall told Fox News that Austin beat her three times and that the 2002 incident was the result of roid rage. She also stated that WWE knew of the abuse, working to conceal the bruises on her face, and kept her from revealing that Austin hit her, as it would cost the company millions of dollars.\n\nDuring his early years as a wrestler, Austin was a technical wrestler. However, after his neck injury against Owen Hart in 1997, he changed his style from technical to brawler. His most famous finishing move is the Stone Cold Stunner, or simply Stunner. During his time as The Ringmaster he used the Million Dollar Dream as finisher, since it was Ted DiBiase's finisher. During his time in WCW, Austin used the Stun Gun as finisher\n\nOne of Austin's taunts during the Attitude Era was to show the middle finger.] In August 2001, Austin cut a promo, debuting his catchphrase \"What?\", which is used today by fans when they want to mock wrestlers during promos",

He has appeared in movies such as Re-Animator, Bad Dreams, The Prophecy II, Out of Time, and Bride of Re-Animator, and the TV series Dark Justice.\n\nAbbott's career began as a dancer/actor in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon, where he spent three seasons in the late 1970s. In 1980, Abbott relocated from Portland to Hollywood (\"in the middle of the actors' strike, and I didn't know Anyone,\" he recalls). Shortly afterwards, he was cast as the villain in the movie Tag: The Assassination Game. He met his future (first) wife, Linda Hamilton on the set. The union produced one child, Dalton Bruce (born October 4, 1989) (who can be seen in Terminator II as \"Infant John Connor\").\n\nBruce and Linda divorced circa 1989. That same year, on the Dallas, Texas, set of the TV movie Trapped, Abbott met actress Kathleen Quinlan. They married April 12, 1994 and have 1 son, Tyler Quinlan (born October 17, 1990).\n\nThroughout his career, Abbott has been a guest star on many TV series Murder She Wrote, Family Law, Diagnosis: Murder, and more. He had a recurring role in the short-lived series The Net, based on the film of the same title starring Sandra Bullock.\n\nAbbott is semi-retired from acting. He is an architect and artist and works in the custom-design industry. He has designed his last two homes.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bruce Abbott, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is best known for co-writing the screenplay for the movie Evil Dead II with longtime friend, film director Sam Raimi, with whom he attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan. Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi's Within the Woods, which served as a precursor to The Evil Dead.\n\nWhen Spiegel first moved to Los Angeles, he shared a house in with directors Raimi and Joel Coen, producer Ethan Coen and actresses Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand and Kathy Bates. He shared yet another house with roommate and film editor Bob Murawski (Spider-Man). In the early 1990s, he introduced film director Quentin Tarantino to producer Lawrence Bender, who helped Tarantino get Reservoir Dogs made.\n\nSpiegel grew up in what was then \"rural\" Birmingham, Michigan. He attended Walnut Lake Elementary school and then went on to attend West Maple Jr. High School. It was here that Scott met Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Spiegel worked at the local grocery market across from Walnut Lake Elementary School and it is from this market that Scott would later draw upon the memories to come up with classic scenes that would eventually be worked into many of the scenes of the movies he would either write or direct.\n\nIn 1999, Spiegel directed the direct-to-video sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn, Texas Blood Money. Spiegel formed the production company Raw Nerve with film directors Eli Roth, and Boaz Yakin. Raw Nerve produced the film Hostel (2005), directed by Roth.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Scott Spiegel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nIan Charleson (11 August 1949 \u2013 6 January 1990) was a Scottish stage and film actor. He is best known internationally for his starring role as Olympic athlete and missionary Eric Liddell, in the Oscar-winning 1981 film Chariots of Fire. He is also well known for his portrayal of Rev. Charlie Andrews in the 1982 Oscar-winning film Gandhi.\n\nCharleson was a noted actor on the British stage as well, with critically acclaimed leads in Guys and Dolls, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Fool for Love, and Hamlet, among many others. Over the course of his life Charleson performed numerous major Shakespearean roles, and the annual Ian Charleson Awards were established in his honour in 1991, to reward the best classical stage performances in Britain by actors aged under 30.\n\nThe Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography describes Charleson as \"a leading player of charm and power\" and \"one of the finest British actors of his generation.\" Alan Bates wrote that Charleson was \"definitely among the top ten actors of his age group.\" Ian McKellen said Charleson was \"the most unmannered and unactorish of actors: always truthful, always honest.\"\n\nCharleson was diagnosed with HIV in 1986, and died in 1990 at the age of 40. He requested that it be announced after his death that he had died of AIDS, in order to publicize the condition. This was the first show-business death in the United Kingdom openly attributed to AIDS, and helped to promote awareness of the disease.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ian Charleson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His portrayals of Christy Brown in My Left Foot (1989), Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood (2007) and Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln (2012) won Academy and BAFTA Awards for Best Actor, and Screen Actors Guild as well as Golden Globe Awards for There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. His role as Bill \"The Butcher\" Cutting in Gangs of New York (2002) earned him the BAFTA Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nDay-Lewis, who grew up in London, is the son of actress Jill Balcon and the Anglo-Irish Poet Laureate, Cecil Day-Lewis. He is a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. Often, he will remain completely in character for the duration of the shooting schedule of his films, even to the point of adversely affecting his health. He is known as one of the most selective actors in the film industry, having starred in only seven films since 1997, with as many as five years between roles. Throughout his career Day-Lewis has received numerous accolades and remains the only actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor three times. In 2012, Time magazine named Day-Lewis \"The World's Greatest Actor\". In 2017, Day-Lewis announced his retirement from acting, with Phantom Thread (2017) being his final film role.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Daniel Day-Lewis, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nGarry Emmanuel Shandling (born November 29, 1949) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, director, writer, and producer. He was best known for his work in It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show.\n\nShandling began his career writing for sitcoms such as Sanford and Son and Welcome Back, Kotter. He made a successful stand-up performance on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and became a frequent guest-host on the show. Shandling was for a time considered the leading contender to replace Carson (other hopefuls were Joan Rivers, David Letterman and David Brenner).

    "biography": "Born June 12, 1970 in New York City, New York and raised in Roslyn Heights, New York, Rick Hoffman graduated from The Wheatley School in Old Westbury, NY before attending the University of Arizona. After graduating from University of Arizona, Rick moved to Los Angeles to start an acting career. He landed his first role as a security guard in Conspiracy Theory (1997) . He was so nervous he flubbed his two lines. Fortunately, his misread got laughs from Julia Roberts , Richard Donner and the entire crew, and was included in the final cut, giving him some much-needed attention.\n\nAfter other small roles, he had his breakout role as the Freddie Sacker on Darren Star 's Wall Street series The $treet (2000) which allowed him to quit his job waiting tables and move back to New York. He has had several memorable roles on series like Terry Loomis on the critically acclaimed Steven Bochco law drama Philly (2001) . These roles caught Variety magazine's attention who elected Rick one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch. Then came the role of Jerry Best on The Bernie Mac Show (2001), and Patrick Van Dorn on the John Stamos comedy series Jake in Progress (2005).\n\nHe has had many supporting appearances in movies including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Blood Work (2002), Hostel (2005), Cellular (2004), and Lions Gate Films The Condemned (2007). He suffered a near-death experience during the filming of the latter in Australia.",

    "biography": "A Welsh-born English actor. In addition to starring roles in big budget Hollywood films, he has long been heavily involved in films produced by independent producers and art houses. Bale first caught the public eye when he was cast in the starring role of Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun at the age of 13, playing an English boy who is separated from his parents and subsequently finds himself lost in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. Since then, he has portrayed a wide range of characters. Bale is especially noted for his cult following: the tenth anniversary issue of Entertainment Weekly hailed him as one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures of the Past Decade\", citing his cult status on the Internet. EW called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\" in anticipation of the release American Psycho (2000). The Guardian named Bale as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nBale was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales to parents of English descent. His father, David Bale, was an entrepreneur, commercial pilot, and talent manager and his mother, Jenny James, was a circus clown and performer. He is the youngest of four children. After leaving Wales in 1976, Bale spent his childhood in several countries, including England, Portugal and the United States. Settling for four years in Bournemouth and Henley-on-Thames, Bale was educated at Shiplake C of E Primary School, the independent Dolphin School in Berkshire, and at Bournemouth School. He participated actively in rugby union. Bale has described his childhood, with respect to his mother being in the circus, as \"interesting\". He recalled his first kiss was with an acrobat named Barta. As a child, he trained in ballet and guitar. His sister Louise's work in theatre also influenced his decision to become an actor. Bale's father was very supportive of his son's acting, resigning from his job as a commercial pilot to travel and manage Bale's burgeoning career. Bale's first foray into acting was a commercial for the fabric softener Lenor in 1982, when he was eight years old. He appeared in a Pac-Man cereal commercial playing a child rock star a year later and in 1984 made his stage debut in The Nerd, opposite Rowan Atkinson.\n\nOn 29 January, 2000, Bale married Sandra \"Sibi\" Bla\u017ei\u0107 (born 1970), a one-time model, make-up artist and personal assistant to Winona Ryder; the couple have a daughter, Emmeline, who was born on 27 March 2005, in Santa Monica, California. Since 1992, Bale has resided in Los Angeles.",

    "biography": "Kate Noelle \"Katie\" Holmes (born December 18, 1978) is an American actress and director. Born in Toledo, Ohio, teen modelling led to a supporting role in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm, before she found international fame as Joey Potter on the teen drama Dawson's Creek from 1998 to 2003. She transitioned to film in her hiatuses between seasons, appearing in movies including Doug Liman's Go, Curtis Hanson's Wonder Boys, and Joel Schumacher's Phone Booth.\n\nDuring promotion for her role in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, Holmes began a highly publicized relationship with actor Tom Cruise. The couple were engaged within two months of meeting, with Holmes converting from Roman Catholicism to the Church of Scientology, and Cruise flamboyantly professing his love for her during a controversial episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. Months later, the couple produced a daughter, Suri, before marrying in November 2006.\n\nHolmes went on to make her Broadway debut in a revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons, portray Jacqueline Kennedy in the Reelz mini-series The Kennedys, and launched a short-lived fashion line. Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise in July 2012, gaining custody of her daughter and moving to New York, where she returned to the Roman Catholic Church. While tabloids have long speculated on the circumstances of the couple's divorce, Holmes has declined to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nFollowing her divorce, Holmes returned to film with roles in The Giver, Woman in Gold and Steven Soderbergh's Logan Lucky, and recurred on the Showtime series Ray Donovan. In 2016, she made her feature directorial debut with the mother-daughter drama All We Had.",

There Londoner developed his talent which after a few years we are able to see on the television screens. After three years in Dadov, he enrolled in the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in New York in the class of Professor Ron Maston. In the same class, among others, were Stephen Amell, Katie Cassidy, Italia Ricci and Caity Lotz.\n\nThe audience may remember Londoner for his role as Andrew Richards in the horror movie \"Thinner\". This role had considerable influence on the development of his career. \"Theodore Rex\", the movie title from 1995 may have been very popular with the public, but it was broadcast in prime time TV, in which you could also see young Kenneth. The movie starred Whoopie Goldberg and was directed and screenplayed by Jonathan R. Betuel. This movie was very popular with the younger audience.\n\nA some time later, Kenneth Londoner starred in several other TV series projects.\n\nIn 2004 Kenneth\u2019s starred in a new TV series called \"Secret Lives\". Londoner starred as Tim Seth, a first season regular. This role has delighted all audiences. With his acting talent he showed that in the future audience can expect great plays from him. He waited patiently for his five minutes of glory, and judging by the audience reactions, patience paid off.\n\nAlthough in private life he was not very much into playing football, said that after having weeks spent in training the skills were obvious on the field. He had hard practicing to get to a certain level, although has no talent for this sport. Kenneth Londoner is very serious in business, both as a director and as an actor. In each character he enters meticulously, but agrees to compromise and agree on roles and duties.\n\nBesides acting Ken Londoner is engaged in playing guitar and piano. At one time he had a band. He completed elementary music school, but the love of acting was crucial and brought him in front of the camera. He likes to play in musicals, and his first performance it was the musical Chicago.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nKylie Ann Minogue, OBE ( born 28 May 1968), is an Australian pop singer, songwriter, and actress. After beginning her career as a child actress on Australian television, she achieved recognition through her role in the television soap opera Neighbours, before commencing her career as a recording artist in 1987. Her first single, \"Locomotion\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest selling single of the decade. This led to a contract with songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Her debut album, Kylie (1988), and the single \"I Should Be So Lucky\", each reached number one in the United Kingdom, and over the next two years, her first 13 singles reached the British top ten. Her debut film, The Delinquents (1989) was a box-office hit in Australia and the UK despite negative reviews. Initially presented as a \"girl next door\", Minogue attempted to convey a more mature style in her music and public image. Her singles were well received, but after four albums her record sales were declining, and she left Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992 to establish herself as an independent performer. Her next single, \"Confide in Me\", reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997). It failed to attract strong reviews or sales in the UK, but was successful in Australia. Minogue returned to prominence in 2000 with the single \"Spinning Around\" and the dance-oriented album Light Years, and she performed during the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed. \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" reached number one in more than 40 countries, and the album Fever (2001) was a hit in many countries, including the United States, a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition. Minogue embarked on a concert tour but cancelled it when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2005. After surgery and chemotherapy treatment, she resumed her career in 2006 with Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour. Her tenth studio album X was released in 2007 and was followed by the KylieX2008 tour. In 2009, she embarked upon her For You, For Me Tour, her first concert tour of the United States and Canada, and the following year released her eleventh studio album, Aphrodite. Minogue has achieved worldwide record sales of more than 68 million,[2] and has received notable music awards, including multiple ARIA and Brit Awards and a Grammy Award. She has mounted several successful concert tours and received a Mo Award for \"Australian Entertainer of the Year\" for her live performances. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire \"for services to music\", and an Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2008.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kylie Minogue, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSarah Edwards (October 11, 1881 \u2013 January 7, 1965) was a Welsh-born American film and stage actress. She often played dowagers or spinsters in numerous Hollywood movies of the 1930s and 1940s, mostly in minor roles.  Edwards started her acting career as a stage actress, she was described in 1916 by a newspaper article as a leading actress \"very popular with West End theatre-goers\".[1] She eventually settled in the United States and appeared in six Broadway plays between 1919 and 1931, primarily in comedies like The Merry Malones by George M. Cohan. Among her first movies was the New York-filmed 1929 musical Glorifying the American Girl (1929), where she portrayed the mercenary mother of leading actress Mary Eaton. She came to Hollywood in the mid-1930s where she appeared in about 190 films until her retirement 1951, mostly in uncredited, small character roles. Sarah Edwards died in Hollywood in 1965, aged 83.\n\nEdwards seemed older than she was and often portrayed a \"kindly grandmother, imperious dowager, hardy pioneer wife, ill-tempered teacher and strict governess\". She remains perhaps best-known to modern audiences as the imperious mother of Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) in Frank Capra's film classic It's a Wonderful Life (1946) who tries to keep her daughter away from George Bailey. Edwards also played a customer in Ernst Lubitsch's The Shop Around the Corner (1940) with James Stewart. She also appeared in another Christmas classic, The Bishop's Wife (1947) with Cary Grant, and as the wife of a doctor on the train in Hitchcock's thriller Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Edwards sometimes also portrayed more substantial roles, for instance in the Charlie Chan movie Charlie Chan in the Secret Service (1944).",

Baldwin Jr. (January 2, 1889 \u2212 January 27, 1977) was a prolific character actor whose career spanned five decades and 150 film and television roles, and numerous stage performances.\n\nBaldwin was born in Lima, Ohio from a theatrical family and served in the First World War.\n\nHe was probably best known for playing the father of the handicapped sailor in The Best Years of Our Lives. He was the first actor to portray \"Floyd the Barber\" on The Andy Griffith Show.\n\nPrior to his first film roles in 1939, Baldwin had appeared in more than a dozen Broadway plays. He played Whit in the first Broadway production of Of Mice and Men, and also appeared in the original Grand Hotel in a small role, as well as serving as the production's stage manager. He originated the role of Bensinger, the prissy Chicago Tribune reporter, in the Broadway production of The Front Page.\n\nIn the 1960s he had small acting roles in television shows such as Petticoat Junction and Green Acres. He continued to act in motion pictures, and one of his last roles was in Rosemary's Baby.\n\nBaldwin was known for playing solid middle class burghers, although sometimes he gave portrayals of eccentric characters. He played a customer seeking a prostitute in The Lost Weekend and the rebellious prison trusty Orvy in Cry of the City. Walter Baldwin was featured in a lot of John Deere Day Movies from 1949-59 where he played the farmer Tom Gordon. In this series of Deere Day movies over a decade he helped to introduce many new pieces of John Deere farm equipment year-by-year. In each yearly movie he would be shown on his in A Tom Gordon Family Film where he would be buying new John Deere farm equipment or a new green and yellow tractor.A picture of Walter Baldwin playing Tom Gordon can be found on page 108 of Bob Pripp's book John Deere Yesterday & Today\n\nHal Erickson writes in Allmovie: \"With a pinched Midwestern countenance that enabled him to portray taciturn farmers, obsequious grocery store clerks and the occasional sniveling coward, Baldwin was a familiar (if often unbilled) presence in Hollywood films for three decades.\"",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nRoss Patterson is an American film actor who has appeared in over 15 films including The New Guy, Accepted, and the 2006 Sundance film The Darwin Awards. Ross has also written, starred, and produced in five films, 7-10 Split, Screwball: The Ted Whitfield Story, Darnell Dawkins Mouth Guitar Legend, Poolboy: Drowning Out The Fury, and FDR: American Badass!, as well a pilot for MTV in 2007 entitled The Barnes Brothers which did not get picked up at upfronts. He was recently nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Spoof in 2008. Ross was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity at Ohio State University in the late 1990s. He got his start in stand-up comedy by using a fake ID in Atlanta, Georgia when he was 16 years old.\n\nRoss can be seen as the fast talking hollywood music producer \"Joey Zane\" in the movie Garden Party opening July 11, 2008 in Los Angeles, New York, Portland, and Seattle. See the Garden Party website for more details.\n\nPatterson just finished filming Darnell Dawkins: Mouth Guitar Legend in January 2010. Film is based on the popular YouTube short film of the same name that has garnered over 800,000 views. He wrote, starred, and produced this film as well.\n\nHe is currently filming the action-comedy \"Poolboy: Drowning Out The Fury\" starring opposite Danny Trejo, Jason Mewes, and Kevin Sorbo. \"It's an unearthed lost movie from 1990 that the studio deemed too terrible to release, a Vietnam Veteran Sal Bando(Sorbo), tortured by his past as a Poolboy returns home to Van Nuys, California, and a country he doesn't recognize, in which it seems only Mexicans run pool-cleaning companies. Bando sets off on a brutal mission to reclaim his \"rightful\" vocation and enact revenge on the man(Trejo) who killed his wife and son.\"(according to IMDB)\n\nScrewball: The Ted Whitfield Story is due out October 1st through Warner Brothers.\n\nAccording to Production Weekly, Patterson is filming another film he wrote and is producing called \"FDR: American Badass!\" and is playing a role opposite Barry Bostwick(FDR) and Bruce McGill. Production started December 6, 2010 in Los Angeles and supposedly features the 32nd President of the United States riding a \"wheelchair of death\" to stop the world from werewolves who carry the polio virus, including werewolf versions of Hitler, Mussolini, and Emperor Hirohito.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Becky Ross Patterson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",

    "biography": "Claude Rains (10 November 1889 \u2013 30 May 1967) was an English stage and film actor whose career spanned 47 years; he later held American citizenship. He was known for many roles in Hollywood  films, among them the title role in The Invisible Man (1933), a corrupt senator in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington  (1939), and, perhaps his most famous performance, Captain Renault in Casablanca (1942).\n\nRains was born William Claude Rains in Camberwell, London on November 10, 1889. He grew up, according to his daughter, with \"a very serious cockney accent and a speech impediment\".  His father was British stage actor Frederick Rains, and the young Rains made his stage debut at 11 in Nell of Old Drury.\n\nHis acting talents were recognised by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, founder of The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Tree paid for the elocution lessons Rains needed in order to succeed as an actor. Later, Rains taught at the institution, teaching John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, among others.\n\nRains served in the First World War in the London Scottish Regiment, with fellow actors Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman and Herbert Marshall. Rains was involved in a gas attack that left him nearly blind in one eye for the rest of his life. However, the war did aid his social advancement and, by its end, he had risen from the rank of Private to Captain.\n\nRains began his career in the London theatre, having a success in the title role of John Drinkwater's play Ulysses S. Grant, the follow-up to the playwright's major hit Abraham Lincoln, and traveled to Broadway in the late 1920s to act in leading roles in such plays as Shaw's The Apple Cart and in the dramatizations of The Constant Nymph, and Pearl S. Buck's novel The Good Earth, as a Chinese farmer.\n\nRains came relatively late to film acting and his first screen test was a failure, but his distinctive voice won him the title role in James Whale's The Invisible Man (1933) when someone accidentally overheard his screen test being played in the next room. Rains later credited director Michael Curtiz with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or \"what not to do in front of a camera\".",

Guerra was born a Portuguese citizen in Louren\u00e7o Marques (today Maputo) in Mozambique, when it was still Portuguese colony.\n\nGuerra studied at IDHEC film school in Paris from 1952. In 1958 he started his career as an assistant director in several French films. Later on he immigrated to Brazil, where he directed his first feature film, Os Cafajestes (1962). It was entered into the 12th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nIn 1964, Guerra directed Os Fuzis, which placed him in the forefront of the emerging Cinema Novo movement. The film was entered into the 14th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize.\n\nAfter that he directed the international production Tendres Chasseurs (1969) starring Sterling Hayden, and Os Deuses e os Mortos (1970). The tumultuous political landscape in 1970's Brazil forced Guerra to stop filming until 1976, when he directed A Queda. The film was entered into the 28th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize.\n\nIn 1980 he returned to Mozambique where he shot Mueda, Mem\u00f3ria e Massacre, that country's first feature film. While in Mozambique, Guerra shot many short films and helped the creation of the National Institute for Cinema.\n\nIn 1982 Guerra shot Er\u00e9ndira in Mexico, based on the work by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. He also directed the musical comedy A \u00d3pera do Malandro (1985), based on Chico Buarque's free theatrical adaptation of Bertold Brecht's Threepenny Opera; the TV film Os Amores Dif\u00edceis, another adaptation of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez; and Kuarup (1989). In 2000 Guerra's Estorvo was nominated for the Golden Palm at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. It was Guerra's third nomination in the festival, after Er\u00eandira and Kuarup. His 2004 film Portugal S.A. was the only film he did in Portugal and entered into the 26th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ruy guerra licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJacqueline Susan McKenzie \u00a0(born 24 October 1967) is an Australian actress. McKenzie made her film debut in the 1987 film Wordplay and on stage in Child Dancing for Griffin Theatre Company. She made a strong impression in Romper Stomper (1992), and over the next couple of years came to be regarded as one of Australia's most promising young actresses. She received Australian Film Institute Award nominations for her roles in Stark, This Won't Hurt a Bit (both 1993), The Battlers and Traps (both 1994) before winning two awards in 1995 for \"Best Actress in a Television Drama\" for Halifax f.p: \"Lies of the Mind\", and Best Actress in a Leading Role\" for Angel Baby. With this success she ventured to the United States and secured a Green Card, as a \"Person of Extraordinary Ability\". She subsequently had acting roles in films such as Deep Blue Sea (1999) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002). In 2004, she began playing the lead female role Diana Skouris in the science fiction television series The 4400, one of the year's biggest successes. The show ran for four seasons, ending in 2007. She also played a lead role in an episode of Two Twisted (2006), an Australian television program. McKenzie appeared on television again in 2006 playing Linda Landry in \"Umney's Last Case\", the third episode of Nightmares and Dreamscapes on TNT. She has recorded a collection of songs: \"Shy Baby\", \"Boo Boo\", \"Find Me\", \"Summer\", \"Under The Elm\" and \"Ever\". \"Shy Baby\" was used in the second season finale of The 4400, and will be included in the show's soundtrack released in April 2007. She was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. In 1996, a portrait of McKenzie by Garry Shead was a finalist in the Archibald Prize. The prize is awarded for the \"best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics\". McKenzie became mother to a daughter in June 2009. From 7 February to 27 March 2011, she will appear in In the Next Room or the Vibrator Play by Sarah Ruhl at the Sydney Opera House with the Sydney Theatre Company\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jacqueline McKenzie, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

    "biography": "Anthony Hopkins was born on 31 December 1937, in Margam, Glamorgan, Wales. Influenced by Richard Burton, he decided to study at College of Music and Drama in Cardiff and graduated in 1957. In 1965, he moved to London and joined the National Theatre, invited by Laurence Olivier, who could see the talent in Hopkins. In 1967, he made his first film for television, A Flea in Her Ear (1967) (TV).\n\nFrom this moment on, he enjoyed a successful career in cinema and television. In 1968, he worked on The Lion in Winter (1968) with Timothy Dalton. Many successes came later, and Hopkins' remarkable acting style reached the four corners of the world. In 1977, he appeared in two major films: A Bridge Too Far (1977) with James Caan, Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Elliott Gould and Laurence Olivier, and Maximilian Schell. In 1980, he worked on The Elephant Man (1980). Two good television literature adaptations followed: Othello (1981) (TV) and \"Hallmark Hall of Fame: The Hunchback of Notre Dame (#31.2)\" (1982). In 1987 he was awarded with the Commander of the order of the British Empire. This year was also important in his cinematic life, with 84 Charing Cross Road (1987), acclaimed by specialists. In 1993, he was knighted.\n\nIn the 1990s, Hopkins made movies like Desperate Hours (1990) and Howards End (1992), The Remains of the Day (1993) (nominee for the Oscar), Legends of the Fall (1994), Nixon (1995) (nominee for the Oscar), Surviving Picasso (1996), Amistad (1997) (nominee for the Oscar), The Mask of Zorro (1998), Meet Joe Black (1998) and Instinct (1999). His most remarkable film, however, was The Silence of the Lambs (1991), for which he won the Oscar for Best Actor. He also got a BAFTA for this role. IMDb Mini Biography By: Emerenciano",

He caught the attention and earned the admiration of Director\u00a0Taylor Hackford, who encouraged Michael to pursue a career in stunt work.\n\nWhile filming Charlie's Angels (2000), Michael was kicked in the jaw with a stiletto boot. He found himself in an emergency room, insisting that he was not the victim of domestic violence. The spousal abuse representatives had a hard time believing that he had been kicked by\u00a0Cameron Diaz\n\n.Michael is most widely known as \"The Carjacker\" in Spider-Man (2002), whose actions ultimately lead Peter Parker to become Spider-Man. Michael first met director\u00a0Sam Raimi\n\n\u00a0when he played\u00a0Kevin Costner's nemesis in For Love of the Game (1999).\n\nAnother notable role was as Guard Papajohn in The Longest Yard (2005) for producerAdam Sandler\n\n. They met when Michael did all of Adam's stunts in The Waterboy (1998), making the hard hits as Bobby Boucher. In The Longest Yard, things came full circle when Michael had his own stuntman.\n\nHe has produced one film, Rustin (2001), that went on to win festival awards.  IMDb Mini Biography By:\u00a0PRMP",

    "biography": "Yuki Matsuzaki, born in Miyazaki, Japan began acting at the age of 7 in a small theatrical group that performed for children. He performed over 50 shows in local theaters until he was 18. Upon graduating high school, he decided to dedicate his life to acting and moved to New York City to become an accomplished actor with the versatility to perform in both English and Japanese. Upon his arrival, all his money was stolen and he became homeless. In order to survive, he started performing on the streets of Times Square where his first day tally after performing 8-hours was a mere $4.00.\n\nAll his endurance and hard work was rewarded when Edward Zwick cast Yuki for\u00a0The Last Samuri\u00a0(2003). He began booking roles in such films as\u00a0Drunken Sword\u00a0(2005) and Roku\u00a0(2005). Next Clint Eastwood cast him as Nozaki in\u00a0Letters from Iwo Jima\u00a0(2006). Eastwood favored Yuki for his unique preparation. In order to prepare for his role, Yuki only digested celery and water for five weeks to experience famine, confined himself inside dark closets and bathrooms to recreate the claustrophobic atmosphere for the cave fighting sequences. After\u00a0Letters from Iwo Jima\u00a0(2006), NBC offered Yuki a co-star role in their hit TV show\u00a0Heroes\u00a0(2006/II).\n\nIn 2009, Matsuzaki starred alongside Steve Martin, Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina and Aishwarya Rai as a member of an international dream team of detectives in Pink Panther 2 (2009).",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nRichard Henry Sellers, CBE (8 September 1925 \u2013 24 July 1980), known as Peter Sellers, was a British comedian and actor best known as Chief Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther film series, for playing three different characters in Dr. Strangelove, as Clare Quilty in Lolita, and as the man-child and TV-addicted Chance the gardener in his penultimate film, Being There. Leading actress Bette Davis once remarked of him, \"He isn't an actor\u2014he's a chameleon.\"  Sellers rose to fame on the BBC Radio comedy series The Goon Show. His ability to speak in different accents (e.g., French, Indian, American, German, as well as British regional accents), along with his talent to portray a range of characters to comic effect, contributed to his success as a radio personality and screen actor and earned him national and international nominations and awards. Many of his characters became ingrained in public perception of his work. Sellers' private life was characterized by turmoil and crises, and included emotional problems and substance abuse. Sellers was married four times, and had three children from the first two marriages.\n\nAn enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played, but he left his own portrait since, \"he obsessively filmed his homes, his family, people he knew, anything that took his fancy right to the end of his life\u2014intimate film that remained undiscovered until long after his death in 1980.\" The director Peter Hall has said: \"Peter had the ability to identify completely with another person, and think his way physically, mentally and emotionally into their skin. Where does that come from? I have no idea. Is it a curse? Often. I think it's not enough though in this business to have talent. You have to have talent to handle the talent. And that I think Peter did not have.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Peter Sellers, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

And secondly, buddying up with ex-wrestler Roddy Piper in the weird sci-fi satire Hell Comes to Frogtown (1988), in which once again Bergman puts her fighting skills to good use and she clobbers a lot of frog creatures!\n\nBergman has appeared in about thirty films; however she's definitely at her best when demonstrating her athletic prowess!",

    "biography": "Born and raised in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, a small town near Pittsburgh. He is the middle son of Petro and Despina Maropis and is very close to his brothers, Sam and Chris.\n\nBeing an exceptional all-around athlete in high school (Burgettstown High-school in southwest Pennsylvania), it appeared Adoni would pursue a professional career in some sport. Turning down various athletic scholarships, he enrolled at West Virginia University and graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration.\n\nBut, from years of being entertained by Adoni's impromptu comedic performances and impersonations which began when he was a small child, his father, Petro, told him that the suit and tie of the business world would probably choke him to death and encouraged Adoni to give acting a shot. Surprised, yet intrigued at this suggestion, Adoni enrolled at a performing arts school, Point Park College (now a University) in Pittsburgh, and studied acting, dialects, singing, and a bit of dance.\n\nHis first stage role was as a freshman, even though freshman weren't allowed to perform at the time, where they needed him as an \"Arabian Carrier\" in The Nutcracker Sweet. Not only did Adoni get to flex his muscles in that role, but he also played the \"Jack-in-the-Box\" in the same production. Some of his other memorable plays and musicals were: Working, Evita, Getting Out, You Can't Take it With You, and Little Shop of Horrors where he played the man-eating plant, \"Audrey II.\" After three years of theatre at Point Park, with the help of his younger brother Chris, he headed for Hollywood.\n\nAlthough Adoni is truly blessed with a more than usual dose of athletic ability and creative talent, what truly makes Adoni stand out is that he is a Type 1 Diabetic, and has been since he was 18 months old. His parents were told he would be weak and sickly, and in and out of hospitals his whole life. Ultimately, a renowned diabetic specialist told his father that most likely Adoni would be dead by the age of 25. As Adoni puts it, \"I get a kick out of someone saying I can't do it.\" This has been proven by his numerous athletic awards and championships throughout high-school and college which involved everything - strength, speed, quickness and finesse. The list includes: tennis, basketball, baseball, football, weightlifting, arm-wrestling, fitness, and his favorite pastime, which is table tennis (ping-pong). Adoni loves being creative with his workouts which involve only 30-45 minutes per day of either running, biking, aerobics, some martial arts, or what he calls his \"unique, unnatural, yet truly natural Cirque du Soleil/Tarzan workout\".\n\nSome of Adoni's diverse and memorable roles include: the flamboyant evil sorcerer, Quan Chi, in the TV show \"Mortal Kombat: Conquest\" (1998), the sarcastic undercover agent in The Gristle (2001), \"Abu-Fayed,\" in Season 6 of the Fox hit series \"24\" (2001) and the regal falcon-man in Hidalgo (2004), starring Viggo Mortensen. An inspiration to the world, Adoni will tell you that the most important ingredients to success and happiness are - love, laughter, and fitness! He credits his family and a few good friends with supplying all three.",

He is best known for playing Fox Mulder on The X-Files and Hank Moody on Californication, both of which have earned him Golden Globe awards  Duchovny was born in New York City, New York in 1960. He is the son of Margaret \"Meg\" (n\u00e9e Miller), a school administrator and teacher, and Amram \"Ami\" Ducovny (1927\u20132003), a writer and publicist who worked for the American Jewish Committee. His father was Jewish, from a family that immigrated from the Russian Empire and Poland. His mother is a Lutheran emigrant from Aberdeen, Scotland. His father dropped the h in his last name to avoid the sort of mispronunciations he encountered while serving in the Army.\n\nDuchovny attended Grace Church School and The Collegiate School For Boys; both are in Manhattan. He graduated from Princeton University in 1982 with a B.A. in English Literature. He was a member of Charter Club, one of the university's eating clubs. In 1982, his poetry received an honorable mention for a college prize from the Academy of American Poets. The title of his senior thesis was The Schizophrenic Critique of Pure Reason in Beckett's Early Novels. Duchovny played a season of junior varsity basketball as a shooting guard and centerfield for the varsity baseball team.\n\nHe received a Master of Arts in English Literature from Yale University and subsequently began work on a Ph.D. that remains unfinished. The title of his uncompleted doctoral thesis was Magic and Technology in Contemporary Poetry and Prose. At Yale, he was a student of popular literary critic Harold Bloom.\n\nDuchovny married actress T\u00e9a Leoni on May 6, 1997. In April 1999, Leoni gave birth to a daughter, Madelaine West Duchovny. Their second child, a son, Kyd Miller Duchovny, was born in June 2002. Duchovny is a former vegetarian and, as of 2007, is a pescetarian.\n\nOn August 28, 2008, Duchovny announced that he had checked himself into a rehabilitation facility for treating sex addiction. On October 15, 2008, Duchovny's and Leoni's representatives issued a statement revealing they had separated several months earlier.A week later, Duchovny's lawyer said that he planned to sue the Daily Mail over an article it ran that claimed he had an affair with Hungarian tennis instructor Edit Pakay while still married to Leoni, a claim that Duchovny has denied. On November 15, 2008, the Daily Mail retracted their claims. After getting back together, Duchovny and Leoni once again split on June 29, 2011.",

    "biography": "Kareena Kapoor often informally referred to as Bebo,  is an Indian  film actress who appears in Bollywood  films. Born into a film family where both her parents, Randhir Kapoor and Babita, and her elder sister Karisma were actors, Kapoor faced the media spotlight from a very young age. However, she did not make her acting debut until the 2000 film Refugee, which earned her the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award. Her melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham became India's highest grossing film in the overseas market in 2001 and is her biggest commercial success to date.\n\nAfter receiving negative reviews for a series of repetitive roles between 2002 and 2003, Kapoor accepted more demanding parts in order to avoid being typecast. Consequently, from 2004 to 2006 she was recognized by critics for displaying greater versatility. Her portrayal of a sex worker in Chameli (2004) proved to be the turning point in her career and garnered her the Filmfare Special Performance Award. She later received two Critics Awards for Best Actress at the Filmfare ceremony for her performances in the critically acclaimed Dev (2004) and Omkara (2006).\n\nIn 2007, Kapoor earned a Filmfare Best Actress Award for her performance in the Imtiaz Ali directed romantic comedy film, Jab We Met. Although the box office earnings of her films have varied considerably, Kapoor has established herself as one of the leading contemporary actresses in the Hindi film industry. Kapoor's off-screen life is subject to wide media coverage in India with frequent press coverage of her and boyfriend, actor Saif Ali Khan and speculation of a possible marriage.",

    "biography": "Gavan O'Herlihy (6' 2\u00bd\" | 1.89 m) an Irish actor, was born on April 29, 1954 (Taurus) in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Elsa Bennett and Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy. He has a Brother, Cormac O'Herlihy and a sister, Patricia O'Herlihy. He is the brother-in-law of Cornelia Hayes O'Herlihy, nephew of Michael O'Herlihy, and Uncle of Micaela O'Herlihy and Colin O'Herlihy. In his youth, he was an avid tennis player, and even became Irish National Tennis Champion. He is known for Willow (1988), Never Say Never Again (1983) and The Descent: Part 2 (2009), but has over thirty screen credits to his name, most of them having cast him in villainous or antagonistic roles such as Death Wish 3, Never Say Never Again, Superman III, and Tales From The Crypt. His role as Airk Thaughbaer in the 1988 fantasy Willow is one of the few heroic roles the burly, fair-haired Gavan has managed to get, as well as the dashing American officer Captain Leroy in Sharpe's Eagle. He also played the lost jock son \"Chuck Cunningham\" in the first season of Happy Days (1974). Is actually younger (by about two months) than Ron Howard, who played his \"younger\" brother on the show, but it was not a very big part and he was eventually written out by being sent to college and then disappeared with no mention. He did not want to get stuck in television, preferring the film medium. Gavan appeared in the pilot episode of Star Trek: Voyager entitled \"Caretaker\" as the Kazon First Maje, Jabin. He has a son named Rogan and a daughter named Misty.",

She achieved international fame starring as the title role on The CW's action-thriller series Nikita that aired in 2010-2013. In 2014, she will portray the role of Tori Wu in the film adaption of Veronica Roth's bestselling novel Divergent.\n\nQuigley was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. Her father is of Irish and Polish descent and her mother is a Vietnamese immigrant.Her parents met while her father was stationed in Vietnam during the war. Q grew up with four siblings.\n\nQ attended Mililani Waena Elementary School and Wheeler Intermediate School. She then attended Mililani High School, where she was on the cross country, track and field, and swim teams. She won the title of \"Best Body\" senior year, and graduated from Mililani High School in 1997.\n\nMaggie Q is outspoken on the subject of animal rights and has taken part in PETA Asia's campaigns promoting vegetarianism. In a PETA ad, she posed nearly nude in a bed of crimson chili peppers to spread the word that going vegetarian is the best way to \"spice up your life\" as well as help animals, your health, and the environment. A second ad for PETA Asia features her wearing a bikini made entirely of strategically placed lettuce leaves next to the tagline \"Turn Over a New Leaf \u2013 Try Vegetarian!\"\n\nEarly life A vegetarian for many years, she once said that giving up meat is one of the most rewarding decisions she has ever made. \"I feel better, I have more energy on and off the set, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I'm doing something to help stop animal suffering.\" In 2008, Maggie Q was named PETA Asia-Pacific's \"Person of the Year.\" The same year, the organization also listed Q as one of the \"Best-Dressed Celebrities\" of 2008. She has since taken the step to cut all animal products from her diet by becoming a vegan.\n\nShe was also responsible for the removal of all real fur from the wardrobe on the set of Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon.\n\nQ previously dated Hong Kong actor Daniel Wu who also was a costar of Naked Weapon. She has three tattoos: one on each arm and one of a phoenix on her left hip, which she has had to conceal for most of her roles except Nikita. Q also suffered temporary hearing loss in her right ear, when her eardrum was blown out in an explosive stunt.\n\nShe lives in Los Angeles, California, with her three (at one point, eight) rescued dogs.",

He also worked on The Incredibles, Ratatouille and WALL-E. Sohn performed the voice of Emile in Ratatouille. He made his directorial debut with the short film Partly Cloudy in 2009 which he also wrote. In a CGSociety article, Sohn says his idea for Partly Cloudy came from watching Dumbo as a child. In the movie, a stork delivers Dumbo. This made him wonder where the bird gets the babies from. He decided the babies came from clouds and so that is why birds have to deliver them. Partly Cloudy was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2009.\n\nSohn was born and raised in New York. He attended CalArts and while there got a summer job working on Brad Bird's The Iron Giant. After school he worked at The Walt Disney Company and Warner Brothers before coming to Pixar.\n\nRussell, the boy in Up, was based on Peter Sohn.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Peter Sohn, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Of Lebanese and Syrian extraction, the young Michel was raised a Roman Catholic. He was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria and took a degree in mathematics and physics from Cairo University with a major. Afterward graduating from university, he entered the family lumber business. Before making his English-language film debut with \"Lawrence of Arabia\", for which he earned him a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination and international fame, Sharif became a star in Egyptian cinema. His first movie was the Egyptian film Siraa Fil-Wadi (1954) (\"The Blazing Sun\") in 1953, opposite the renowned Egyptian actress Faten Hamama whom he married in 1955. He converted to Islam to marry Hamama and took the name Omar al-Sharif. The couple had one child (Tarek Sharif, who was born in 1957 and portrayed the young Zhivago in the eponymous picture) and divorced in 1974. Sharif never remarried. Beginning in the 1960s, Sharif earned a reputation as one of the world's best known contract bridge players. In the 1970s and '80s, he co-wrote a syndicated newspaper bridge column for the Chicago Tribune. Sharif also wrote several books on bridge and has licensed his name to a bridge computer game, \"Omar Sharif Bridge\", which has been marketed since 1992. Sharif told the press in 2006 that he no longer played bridge, explaining, \"I decided I didn't want to be a slave to any passion any more except for my work. I had too many passions, bridge, horses, gambling. I want to live a different kind of life, be with my family more because I didn't give them enough time.\" As an actor, Sharif had made a comeback in 2003 playing the title role of an elderly Muslim shopkeeper in the French film Monsieur Ibrahim (2003). For his performance, he won the Best Actor Award at the Venice Film Festival and the Best Actor C\u00e9sar, France's equivalent of the Oscar, from the Acad\u00e9mie des Arts et Techniques du Cin\u00e9ma.",

    "biography": "He is perhaps best remembered for his role of Big Ed Somers, the power hungry gangster pal of James Cagney in \"White Heat\" (1949). Born Robert Alexander Cochran in Eureka, California, he was the son of a California lumberjack, who moved the family to Wyoming in the 1920s, where Cochran grew to adulthood. After graduating from the University of Wyoming in 1939, Cochran began working steadily as a Wyoming cowboy, while developing his acting skills working in summer stock and regional theaters and gradually moving on to Broadway. In 1945, he signed with MGM, and for the next several years, played mostly secondary roles as gangsters or boxers. He made his film debut with \"Boston Blackie Booked on Suspicion\" (1945) and quickly followed with \"Wonder Man\" (1945). Released from his contract in 1948, he returned to Broadway where he worked with Mae West; the next year he signed on with Warner Brothers, where he earned leading roles in such films as \"The Damned Don't Cry\" (1950), \"Highway 301\" (1950) and \"Tomorrow is Another Day\" (1951). Warner Brothers often had him playing the villain in several of its western films, such as \"Dallas\" (1950), and \"Back to God's Country\" (1953). With the end of his contract in 1953, he began his own film company, Robert Alexander Productions, while also freelancing for other studios and moving on to guest star roles on television shows. He would show up in such television shows as Death Valley Days, Burke's Law, The Untouchables, Naked City, The Twilight Zone, Route 66, and The Virginian. A notorious womanizer, Cochran was married and divorced three times, and was often in the Hollywood tabloids reportedly having affairs with such actresses as Mae West, Jayne Mansfield, Joan Crawford, Merle Oberon, Ida Lupino and Mamie Van Doren. Cochran died under mysterious circumstances. In May 1965, Cochran had revived his production company, and together with three women, whom he had hired as his assistants, boarded his 40-foot yacht to travel to Central and South America to look for filming locations. On June 25, 1965, the yacht drifted into Port Champerico, Guatemala, with three alive but very distraught women aboard and the body of Steve Cochran, who had died ten days earlier. The women did not know how to operate the boat, and were dependent upon its drifting to shore after his death. There were numerous rumors of murder and poisoning, and actress / former lover Merle Oberon used her influence to push for further police investigation, but no evidence of foul play was ever determined. The official cause of his death was given as Acute Infectious Edema (lung infection).",

In 1982 Reubens put up a show about a character he had been developing during the last few years. The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show and it ran for five sellout months with HBO producing a successful special with it. Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and for the next decade Reubens would be completely committed to his character, doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. In 1985 Pee-wee's Big Adventure, directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton, was a financial success and, despite receiving mixed reviews, it developed into a cult film. Big Top Pee-wee, 1988's sequel, was not as successful as its predecessor. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday morning children's program Pee-wee's Playhouse.",

He also received a BAFTA nomination for the former movie and won an Emmy for his performance in Brian's Song (1971). \u00a0\n\nExpelled from high school for fighting, Warden eventually fought as a professional boxer under the name Johnny Costello winning 13 welterweight bouts to little financial success. \u00a0 Warden worked a number of odd jobs before joining the United States military in 1938, rotating through numerous branches of the US armed forces, finishing his career as a Master Sergeant with the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. \u00a0\n\nFollowing his military service, Warden studied theatre, performing on stage for five years, before making his television debut in 1948 on The Philco Television Playhouse and Studio One. \u00a0He earned his first credited film role with The Man with My Face in 1952, just prior to his breakout performance as Juror No. 7 in 12 Angry Men. Warden continued to appear in many television series and films over the years. He received a supporting actor Emmy Award for his performance as Chicago Bears coach George Halas in the television movie Brian's Song, and was twice nominated for his starring role in the 1980s comedy/drama series, Crazy Like a Fox.  Appearing in more than one hundred movies, Wardon typically played gruff cops, sports coaches, trusted friends or similar roles over his six decade career. \u00a0His final film was The Replacements in 2000, after which he suffered from declining health and retired from acting before passing of heart and kidney failure in a New York hospital at the age of 85. \u00a0",

    "biography": "Dame Judith Olivia \"Judi\" Dench, CH, DBE, FRSA (born 9 December 1934) is an English film, stage and television actress.\n\nDench made her professional debut in 1957 with the Old Vic Company. Over the following few years she played in several of William Shakespeare's plays in such roles as Ophelia in Hamlet, Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. She branched into film work, and won a BAFTA Award as Most Promising Newcomer; however, most of her work during this period was in theatre. Not generally known as a singer, she drew strong reviews for her leading role in the musical Cabaret in 1968.\n\nDuring the next two decades, she established herself as one of the most significant British theatre performers, working for the National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company. In television, she achieved success during this period, in the series A Fine Romance from 1981 until 1984 and in 1992 began a continuing role in the television romantic comedy series As Time Goes By.\n\nHer film appearances were infrequent until she was cast as M in GoldenEye (1995), a role she has played in each James Bond film since.

Originally typecast in exotic roles, often as a vamp or a woman of Asian descent, her career prospects improved following her portrayal of Nora Charles in The Thin Man (1934). Her successful pairing with William Powell resulted in 14 films together, including five subsequent Thin Man films.\n\nAlthough Loy was never nominated for a competitive Academy Award, in March 1991 she was presented with an Honorary Academy Award with the inscription \"In recognition of her extraordinary qualities both on screen and off, with appreciation for a lifetime's worth of indelible performances.\"\n\nDuring World War II, Loy served as assistant to the director of military and naval welfare for the Red Cross. She was later appointed a member-at-large of the U.S. Commission to UNESCO. Her acting career by no means ended in the 1940s. She continued to actively pursue stage and television appearances in addition to films in subsequent decades.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nPhilip Edward \"Phil\" Hartman \u00a0(September 24, 1948 \u2013 May 28, 1998) was a Canadian-born American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and graphic artist. Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family immigrated to the United States when he was ten. After graduating from California State University, Northridge with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like Poco and America. Feeling the need for a more creative outlet, Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show Pee-wee's Playhouse.\n\nHartman became well-known in the late 1980s when he joined the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. He won fame for his impressions, particularly of President Bill Clinton, and stayed on the show for eight seasons. Called \"the Glue\" for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, Hartman won a Primetime Emmy Award for his SNL work in 1989. In 1995, after scrapping plans for his own variety show, he starred as Bill McNeal in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio. He also had frequent roles on The Simpsons as Lionel Hutz, Troy McClure and others, and appeared in the films Houseguest, Sgt. Bilko, Jingle All the Way, and Small Soldiers.\n\nHartman had been divorced twice before he married Brynn (n\u00e9e Omdahl) in 1987; the couple had two children together. However, their marriage was fractured, due in part to Brynn's drug use. On May 28, 1998, Brynn shot and killed her husband while he slept in their Encino, Los Angeles, home, then committed suicide several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was \"the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper...a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Phil Hartman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

Tilton (born December 1, 1958) is an American actress and singer\n\nTilton was born in San Diego, California, the daughter of Katherine, a secretary. Notably, Tilton is 4'11\" (1.50 m) tall. Tilton has had a varied career in show business. She is best known for playing Lucy Ewing, the sly, vixenish, frequently frustrated granddaughter of Jock Ewing in the popular television series Dallas from 1978 to 1985 and from 1988 to 1990 and also on Knots Landing for 1 episode in 1979. She will reprise the role in the pilot of the new series.\n\nIn addition to several appearances on various TV shows, Tilton has also appeared in feature films (including a cameo appearance in the John Milius film Big Wednesday), although these garnered little attention. Tilton is also a singer, singing her own vocals on a 1978 episode of Dallas. She also released a dance-pop single \"C'est La Vie\" in 1984 which became a hit in several countries in Europe, including staying at #1 in Germany.\n\nShe appeared on Circus of the Stars in 1979 and 1991, on one occasion acting as a knife thrower's target girl in a gold bikini.\n\nTilton was the guest host on Saturday Night Live on February 21, 1981. The episode in question featured a parody of the famed \"Who Shot J.R.?\" episode of Dallas. In the episode, cast member Charles Rocket was shot in the chest by a sniper while doing a sketch about a sexy couple (with Gail Matthius as his partner) bathing a dog and spouting innuendo. At the end of the show, as cast members traditionally gathered around the host to say good night, Tilton asked Rocket how he felt about being shot. In character, a wheelchair-using Rocket improvised, \"Oh, man, it\u2019s the first time I've ever been shot in my life. I'd like to know who the fuck did it\".\n\nShe did a number of commercials in the 1990s for the Abdominizer workout equipment. She appeared as herself in an episode of Married... with Children where her involvement with the \"Abdominizer\" was spoofed.\n\nIn 2005, she appeared in the British reality TV show, The Farm.\n\nTilton was married to country singer Johnny Lee from 1982 to 1984 and to Domenick Allen from 1985 to 1992. She has one daughter, Cherish Lee, born in 1982.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Charlene L. Tilton, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Performing in community theaters and local stages since childhood, Zazie found her joy in grade school and grew up acting as a girl. A German-born New York native, Zazie was raised between Washington Heights and Berlin, speaking both German and English with her family at home. She received training from the Harlem School of the Arts and LaGuardia Arts Highschool, but took time to study French, feel fancy, and live in Paris during her time at Skidmore College. Theater continued to live alongside her love for language and travel, so upon graduating in 2013, she decided to muster up her courage and pursue a career in performing.\n\nLiving in Harlem now, she has since had the opportunity to work on various New York films and is happy to find herself on diverse sets, with all kinds of colorful people- navigating her way as a working actress. She has studied with Will Bond and Gameela Wright, collaborated with director Bart Freundlich, and will be starring in Donald Glover\u2019s upcoming television series! Zazie is proud to be a part of this unconventional but beautiful community of performers, and has her heart open for whatever is to come.",

She was named after her great-aunt, from whom she gained the nickname \"Cobie\".\n\nSmulders worked in modeling, which she later said she \"kind of hated\", adding that the experience made her hesitant about pursuing acting as a career: \"You know you go into these rooms, and I've had the experience of people judging you physically for so long and I was over that. But then it was like, 'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice, and I have to have thoughts now'\". After she quit modeling, she registered at the University of Victoria to study marine biology. During the summer, she took acting classes and decided to pursue her acting career.\n\nSmulders' first acting role was as a guest in the Showtime science fiction series Jeremiah, and she has appeared in several television series since, including a recurring role in The L Word. On the New York stage, she has performed in Love, Loss, and What I Wore from at least June 10 to June 27, 2010. Her first permanent series role was in the short-lived ABC series Veritas: The Quest, and her second was television reporter Robin Scherbatsky on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother which quickly became popular. Joss Whedon has suggested that he considered her for the role of Wonder Woman in his draft of the eponymous film, which did not go into production. Smulders played Maria Hill in Whedon's 2012 film The Avengers and reprises her role in the premiere of the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television seriesand both the Russo brothers' 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron in 2015.\n\nSmulders and American actor Taran Killam became engaged in January 2009. They married on September 8, 2012 in Solvang, California. The couple have a daughter, Shaelyn Cado Killam (born May 14, 2009).\n\nSmulders resides in Los Angeles, California.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Cobie Smulders, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

The lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, \"Austin\" spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries (\"All Over Me\" and \"Ol' Red\").[1] Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, he was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001.[citation needed]\n\nHis second and third albums, 2003's The Dreamer and 2004's Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill, are gold and platinum, respectively.[1] His fourth album, Pure BS (2007), was re-issued in 2008 with a cover of Michael Bubl\u00e9's pop hit \"Home\" as one of the bonus tracks.[2] His fifth album, Startin' Fires was released in November 2008.[1] It was followed by the extended plays Hillbilly Bone and All About Tonight in 2010, and the albums Red River Blue in 2011,[3] Based on a True Story... in 2013, Bringing Back the Sunshine in 2014, and If I'm Honest in 2016. As of June 2017, Shelton has charted 33 singles, including 24 number ones,[4] 17 of which were consecutive. The 11th No. 1 (\"Doin' What She Likes\") broke \"the record for the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the Country Airplay chart's 24-year history\".[5] He is a seven-time Grammy Award nominee.[6]\n\nShelton is also known for his role as a judge on the televised singing competitions Nashville Star, Clash of the Choirs, and The Voice. He has been on The Voice since its inception, and in six of fifteen seasons (2\u20134, 7, 11, 13), a member of his team has won. From 2011 to 2015, Shelton was married to singer Miranda Lambert.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMike Connor Gainey (born January 18, 1948) is an American film and television actor whose distinctive mustache, 6'2\u00bd\" height, and threatening look have given him supporting roles as Southern/Southwestern types, thugs, and criminals. M.C. Gainley attended the University of Southern Mississippi prior to moving to California. He worked as an undertaker's apprentice before he decided to study acting. In the early 1970s he attended the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco along with Ken Hixon. In 1981, he made his big-screen debut in the Steve Martin musical Pennies from Heaven. Since the early 1980s he has been in over 50 movies and made for TV movies, including Breakdown, Two Idiots in Hollywood, Con Air, The Mighty Ducks, Are We There Yet, Terminator 3, Sideways, and 2005's The Dukes of Hazzard. He was one of the stars of the short-lived television series Against the Law. He has guest starred on over 40 television shows, including The Dukes of Hazzard, Knight Rider, Designing Women, The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., Walker, Texas Ranger, CSI, Cheers, Days of our Lives, The X-Files, Desperate Housewives, Burn Notice, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and had a role as Tom Friendly on the series Lost, a character who appeared in 20 episodes, as many as some former main cast members. He also played the murderous drug dealer Bo Crowder in a recurring role in the 2010 season of the hit FX TV show Justifed. He attended the 2007 Emmys with Lost's show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. Gainey played Kurtz/The Wizard in the controversial road-revenge film Apocalypse Oz, a film containing no original dialogue as it is all taken from Apocalypse Now or The Wizard of Oz. In 2007 he appeared in a trio of films including Mr. Woodcock, Wild Hogs, and the sci/horror film Unearthed; in 2010 he appeared in Love Ranch. In 2010, he voiced one of the characters of the animated musical film Tangled as Captain of the Palace Guard.",

He progressed to burlesque, Broadway, and even light opera, before making his film debut at the age of 55 in Way Down East (1935). His portrayal was so good, he became stereotyped and played mostly likable old codgers for the rest of his life. Bevans played the neighbour of Gregory Peck in The Yearling and the gatekeeper in Harvey (1950). However, he did occasionally play against type, for example as a Nazi spy in Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942). He also made some television appearances, including the role of murderer Captain Hugo in the 1958 Perry Mason episode \"The Case of the Demure Defendant\" and as Pete in The Twilight Zone episode \"Hocus-Pocus and Frisby\" (1962). He played Captain Cobb in Disney's TV miniseries Davy Crockett.\n\nHis first cousin was actress Merie Earle, best known as Maude Gormley on The Waltons.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nClarence Muse (October 14, 1889\u00a0\u2013 October 13, 1979) was an actor, screenwriter, director, composer, and lawyer. He was inducted in the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in 1973. Muse was the first Negro to \"star\" in a film. He acted for more than sixty years appearing in more than 150 movies.\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Alexander and Mary Muse, he studied at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and received an international law degree in 1911. He was acting in New York by the 1920s, during the Harlem Renaissance with two Harlem theatres, Lincoln Players and Lafayette Players.\n\nMuse moved to Chicago for a while, and then moved to Hollywood and performed in Hearts in Dixie (1929), the first all-black movie. For the next fifty years, he worked regularly in minor and major roles. While with the Lafayette Players, Muse worked under the management of producer Robert Levy on productions that helped black actors to gain prominence and respect. In regards to the Lafayette Theatre's staging of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Muse said the play was relevant to black actors and audiences \"because, in a way, it was every black man's story. Black men too have been split creatures inhabiting one body.\". Muse appeared as an opera singer, minstrel show performer, vaudeville and Broadway actor; he also wrote songs, plays, and sketches. In 1943, he became the first African American Broadway director with Run Little Chillun.\n\nMuse was also the co-writer of several notable songs. In 1931, with Leon Ren\u00e9 and Otis Ren\u00e9, Muse wrote \"When It's Sleepy Time Down South\", also known as \"Sleepy Time Down South\". The song was sung by Nina Mae McKinney in the movie Safe in Hell (1931), and later became a signature song of Louis Armstrong.\n\nHe was the major star in Broken Earth (1936), which related the story of a black sharecropper whose son miraculously recovers from fever through the father's fervent prayer. Shot on a farm in the South with nonprofessional actors (except for Muse), the film's early scenes focused in a highly realistic manner on the incredible hardship of black farmers, with plowing scenes. In 1938, Muse co-starred with boxer Joe Louis in Spirit of Youth, the fictional story of a champion boxer which featured an all black cast. Muse and Langston Hughes wrote the script for Way Down South (1939).\n\nMuse performed in Broken Strings (1940), as a concert violinist who opposes the desire of his son to play \"swing\". From 1955-56, Muse was a regular on the weekly TV version of Casablanca, playing Sam the pianist (a part he was under consideration for in the original Warner Brothers film), and in 1959, he played Peter, the Honey Man, in Porgy and Bess.\n\nHe appeared on Disney's TV miniseries The Swamp Fox. Other film credits include Buck and the Preacher (1972), The World's Greatest Athlete (1973) and as Gazenga's Assistant, \"Snapper\" in Car Wash (1976). His last acting role was in The Black Stallion (1979).",

He began his film career in the early 1980s. He had small roles in such acclaimed films Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever, and Jurassic Park.

One of his bigger roles was as a similarly flustered postman in the thriller Cause for Alarm! in 1952.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Bacon worked steadily in a number of television sitcoms, most notably I Love Lucy, where he appeared in two episodes, one which cast him as Ethel Mertz's father.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nDonald T. Beddoe (July 1, 1903 \u2013 January 19, 1991) was an American character actor.  Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Beddoe was the son of Dan Beddoe, a Welsh classical singer, and his wife Mary. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati with bachelor's and master's degrees and taught English for three years.\n\nAfter a decade of stage work and bit parts in films, Beddoe began more prominent film roles in the late 1930s. He was usually cast as fast-talking reporters and the like. His commercial acting career was put on hold when he served in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, in which he performed in the Air Force play, Winged Victory.\n\nBeddoe subsequently returned to films playing small character roles. He occasionally appeared in comedy shorts playing comic foils, such as in the Three Stooges shorts Three Sappy People and You Nazty Spy!\n\nBeddoe appeared in more than 250 films.\n\nBeddoe portrayed Mr. Tolliver in the ABC comedy The Second Hundred Years, and he was in the cast of Life with Father on CBS. He also was seen in dozens of television programs. In the 1950s and 1960s, he made four appearances on Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel, three times on Lawman, three on Maverick, three on Laramie, three on Lassie, and three on Perry Mason including in the 1958 episode 'The Case of the Buried Clock'. He was also cast on the western aviation series, Sky King, with Kirby Grant, on the ABC/Warner Brothers series, The Alaskans, with Roger Moore, on the ABC adventure series, Straightaway, with Brian Kelly and John Ashley, and on the NBC western series, The Tall Man, with Barry Sullivan and Clu Gulager. He appeared too on the CBS sitcom, Pete and Gladys, with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams, and on the ABC drama series, Going My Way, with Gene Kelly. He guest starred as well on David Janssen's first series, the crime drama, Richard Diamond, Private Detective. He also made appearances on episodes of The Lone Ranger in the '50s.\n\nBeddoe played the outlaw Black Bart in the 1954 episode \"Black Bart The PO8\" of the western anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Black Bart is cast as a debonair poetry-writing former school teacher who turns to stagecoach robbery after his first holdup, a prank, pays handsomely. Wells Fargo detectives track him down through a laundry mark. He was also pursued with a romantic interest by his landlady, Winona Webb (Helen Brown). Black Bart spent six years in the penitentiary, never to be heard from again.\n\nDuring the 1970\u20131971 season of ABC's Nanny and the Professor, Beddoe made four appearances, three as Mr. Thatcher. In 1984, he made his final television appearance as Kris in NBC's Highway to Heaven starring Michael Landon and Victor French.",

Whyte also attended the University of Southern California briefly until he landed a starring role on NBC\u2019s City Guys. Whyte made his film debut in the Mel Gibson/Kurt Russell feature Tequila Sunrise. At age ten, after watching Raiders of the Lost Ark, Whyte figured he could become the next Indiana Jones. But after breaking his wrist swinging from a tree, he set his sights on the goal of becoming an actor, so that he \"could do all those fun things and not get hurt.\" He landed his first part at the age of 13, appearing in a commercial for Pop Tarts, and later appeared in the television series That '70s Show, Just Shoot Me!, The Nanny, Full House, Locals and TNBC's Hang Time, along with hosting the television series Chicken Soup for the Soul, based on the best selling books.

    "biography": "Stephen Hunter was born in Wellington, New Zealand and was unwittingly  cast as \"the clown\" from a young age. The label clearly sat well with  Stephen, who quickly developed a great sense of comic timing, and a  reputation as the \"go to\" funny guy. Very early in his career the camera  beaconed. And after honing his skills on New Zealand Television,  Stephen headed for Australia.\n\nIt didn't take long for his talents  to be recognized - and not just for comedy. In 2006, after several  guest roles on both sides of the Tasman, Stephen landed the part of  Sharpie in the second series of the 2 time Logie Award winning drama  Love My Way. This was closely followed in 2008 by a leading guest role  on Channel 7's long running Australian medical drama All Saints, a role  that showed his depth and versatility as a dramatic actor.\n\nBut it  is his comedic ability that has Stephen in high demand on screen in  both New Zealand and Australia. Stints on Nickelodeans The GO Show and  ABC's Review with Miles Barlow only confirmed that status.\n\nHis  strong resonant voice has also seen Stephen become one of Australasia's  top Voice actors. These skills have been used to promote some of  Australia &amp; New Zealand's top companies and products. And in 2009,  Stephen landed a lead role in the ABC animated series CJ the DJ, as the  lovable Si.\n\nBut it's on screen where his true passion lies - and of course he loves nothing more than making people laugh.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nHarry Julius Shearer \u00a0(born December 23, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer, voice artist, musician, author, radio host and director. He is known for his long-running role on The Simpsons, his work on Saturday Night Live, the comedy band Spinal Tap and his radio program Le Show. Born in Los Angeles, California, Shearer began his career as a child actor, appearing in The Jack Benny Program, as well as the 1953 films Abbott and Costello Go to Mars and The Robe. In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the Eddie Haskell character in the pilot episode for the television series Leave It to Beaver, but his parents decided not to let him continue in the role so that he could have a normal childhood. From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group. Following the break up of the group, Shearer co-wrote the film Real Life with Albert Brooks and started writing for Martin Mull's television series Fernwood 2 Night. In August 1979, Shearer was hired as a writer and cast member on Saturday Night Live. Shearer describes his experience on the show as a \"living hell\" and he did not get along well with the other writers and cast members. He left the show in 1980. Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in the 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap, a satirical rockumentary about a band called Spinal Tap. Shearer portrayed Derek Smalls, the bassist, and Michael McKean and Christopher Guest played the other two members. The film became a cult hit and the band has since released several albums and played several concerts. While promoting the film, Shearer was offered the chance to return to Saturday Night Live. He accepted, but left the show for good in January 1985 after just three months into the season. Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program Le Show on Santa Monica's NPR-affiliated radio station, KCRW. The program, a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy, is carried on many public radio stations throughout the United States. In 1989, Shearer became a part of the cast of The Simpsons. He was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be too much trouble. He felt voice acting was \"not a lot of fun\" because traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately. He provides voices for numerous characters, including Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Kent Brockman, Dr. Hibbert, Lenny Leonard, Principal Skinner, Otto Mann and Rainier Wolfcastle. Shearer has been vocal about what he perceives as the show's declining quality. In 2004, he said \"I rate the last three seasons as among the worst.\" Shearer also directed the 2002 film Teddy Bears' Picnic and appeared in several films, including A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration and Godzilla. Shearer has written three books, Man Bites Town, It's the Stupidity, Stupid, and Not Enough Indians. He has been married to singer-songwriter Judith Owen since 1993. He has received several Primetime Emmy Award and Grammy Award nominations and in 2008 it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Harry Shearer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He made his first West End appearance in 1934 as the hind legs of a horse in a production of \u201cToad of Toad Hall\u201d. From 1936 to 1939 he was a director with the Fred Melville Repertory Company at Brixton. He served in the army during WWII for six years. His performance in 1948 as Rupert Billings in \u201cThe Happiest Days of Your Life\u201d won the Clarence Derwent award.\n\nGordon had a long career in British cinema and television from the 1940s to the 1970s, often playing government officials. His films include The Pink Panther and Casino Royale although he is probably best known for his portrayal of Number Two in the ITC classic series The Prisoner. Along with Leo McKern, he was one of only two actors to play Number Two more than once. He first played the character in \"The General\" and later reprised his role in \"A. B. and C.\". In fact, the episodes were subsequently broadcast in reverse order: when \"The General\" was in production, \"A. B. and C\" had not yet been cast.\n\nGordon was a regular in another ITC production, The Baron playing civil servant Templeton-Green opposite Steve Forrest. He also played the host and occasional narrator of the 1969 London Weekend Television series The Complete and Utter History of Britain, which arose from a pre-Monty Python collaboration between Michael Palin and Terry Jones; and was the Airport Commandant in the 1967 Doctor Who story The Faceless Ones. He was also in Bachelor Father and made a notable guest appearance in The Holiday episode of Steptoe and Son.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Colin Gordon,\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is known to Twin Peaks fans as the multi-faceted villain Windom Earle, and has more recently played the father of Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator.\n\nIn 1984 he was nominated for a Genie Award as Best Actor for his portrayal of Reno Colt in the film \"Reno and the Doc\", written and directed by Charles Dennis. In 1997 Welsh directed Dennis in the latter's play \"SoHo Duo\" at the West Bank Theatre in New York City.\n\nWelsh was born in Edmonton, Alberta to a father who worked for the Canadian National Railway. He grew up in Alberta and studied drama at school. He later moved to Montreal and attended the National Theatre School. Following graduation, he auditioned for the Stratford Festival in Ontario and then spent the first seven years of his career on stage.\n\nWelsh has portrayed historical figures including Thomas E. Dewey, Colin Thatcher, Harry S. Truman (twice), Thomas Edison, James \"Scotty\" Reston, General Harry Crerar and James Baker.\n\nHe has made guest appearances on the acclaimed TV series Due South and Slings and Arrows.\n\nIn 2003, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.\n\nHis role as the Vice-President of the United States in the 2004 environmental disaster film The Day After Tomorrow sparked some controversy due to his physical resemblance to Dick Cheney, who at the time was the real Vice President. Director Roland Emmerich later confirmed that he deliberately chose Welsh for that very reason. Emmerich stated that the character of the Vice-President in the film was intended to be a not-so-subtle criticism of the environmental policies of the Presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kenneth Welsh, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gallo was a painter in the New York City art scene showing with famed art dealer Annina Nosei, performed in a rap duo and was part of the first hip hop television broadcast Graffiti Rock, and played in an industrial band called Bohack which released an album title It Took Several Wives.\n\nIn the early 2000s, he released several solo recordings on WARP records. Gallo is known for his outspoken views and generally sarcastic nature, once stating: \"I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings; and I did it out of spite.\" Gallo was awarded the Coppa Volpi for Best Actor at the 67th Venice International Film Festival for his performance as a wordless escaping Muslim prisoner in Jerzy Skolimowski's Essential Killing. His own feature film Promises Written In Water, which he wrote, directed, produced and starred in, also screened In Competition at the festival.",

    "biography": "A French Canadian from rural New Brunswick, it was clear from an early age that Robert would be a very big boy. In the first grade he stood taller than his teacher and that made him awkward and a bit shy, so growing up he took shelter in his own dreams. One of those dreams was to become a professional wrestler, and for a time he realized that dream with a successful career in the W.W.F. At the urging of a friend, he brought the confidence and poise learned in the ring to the big screen. Among his most memorable performances are the terrifying Uber Immortal in Zack Snyder's 300, the ominous and powerful Dredger in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Homes and the unstoppable Minotaur in Tarsem Singh's Immortals. Maillet appeared in the 2006 film 300, an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name. He played the \u00dcber-Immortal, a savage berserker who was part of the enemy's imperial guard In November 2008, during a fight scene for the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes, he accidentally punched Robert Downey Jr. in the face, bloodying Downey and knocking him down.[6] Downey later stated on an episode of the Late Show with David Letterman that Maillet was \"10 times more upset about it\" than he was.\n\nMaillet played a Russian professional boxer who took a dive in the 2011 film The Big Bang. Later that year, he appeared in the film Monster Brawl as Frankenstein in a wrestling tournament of eight classic monsters that fight to the death. He played Polyphemus in the 2013 film Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, Blackwell in the 2013 film adaptation of The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, and the executioner in the 2014 film Hercules.  also had a recurring role on the Syfy original series Haven billed as a \"Heavy\", a thug for the series antagonist. In 2018, Maillet had a small part in the superhero film Deadpool 2 as Sluggo, a mutant mercenary who is in prison alongside the titular character.He also had a part in the 2018 Netflix film Game Over, Man!.",

Despite being killed-off in season 1, Rex has appeared since in every season (excluding season 4 and 6). During the 2003-04 television season, the hardworking Culp successfully juggled recurring roles on an unheard of four series at one time: on CBS's JAG (1995) (as CIA Agent Clayton Webb), NBC's The West Wing (1999) (as GOP Speaker of the House Jeff Haffley), NBC's long-running hospital drama ER (1994) (as schoolteacher Dave Spencer), and on UPN's futuristic series Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) (as MACO commander Major Hayes). He also managed to squeeze in guest spots on The Lyon's Den (2003) and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000). At the end of that season, Culp had the unusual misfortune to have two of his characters (Webb on JAG and Major Hayes on Star Trek: Enterprise) killed off in the shows' season finales the same week (though Webb turned up very much alive in the subsequent season premiere of JAG). In 2013 Culp joined the cast of NBC's post-apocalyptic drama Revolution (2012) as the clean-cut Patriot Edward Truman, a dignified authority figure. Culp has been married to Barbara Ayers since September 29, 1990. They have two children.",

Brooks excelled at baseball, along with basketball and football throughout high school and thus didn't began pursuing acting until later in his life. He knew he wanted to act from the age of twelve when walking out of a theater after watching Good Will Hunting and knew he wanted to perform in a way to move people's emotions the way he had just been moved. For Brooks, the seed was planted. After four years of college baseball and an undergrad Business Management degree, Brooks went on to grad school where he earned a Masters Degree of Ed in Sports Administration, before he finally began pouring water over that seed through classes, workshops, seminars and other methods. These learning tools combined with becoming a husband and father helped Brooks tap into the ever growing emotional peaks and valleys of life, thus helping him to become the performer he is today.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nMelvin Brooks (n\u00e9 Kaminsky, born June 28, 1926) is an American filmmaker, comedian, actor and composer. He is known as a creator of broad film farces and comic parodies. Brooks began his career as a comic and a writer for the early TV variety show Your Show of Shows. He became well known as part of the comedy duo with Carl Reiner in the comedy skit The 2000 Year Old Man. He also created, with Buck Henry, the hit television comedy series Get Smart, which ran from 1965 to 1970.\n\nIn middle age, Brooks became one of the most successful film directors of the 1970s, with many of his films being among the top 10 moneymakers of the year they were released. His best-known films include The Producers, The Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, History of the World, Part I, Spaceballs and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. A musical adaptation of his first film, The Producers, ran on Broadway from 2001 to 2007.\n\nIn 2001, having previously won an Emmy, a Grammy and an Oscar, he joined a small list of EGOT winners with his Tony award for The Producers. He received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2009, the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2010, the 41st AFI Life Achievement Award in June 2013, a British Film Institute Fellowship in March 2015, a National Medal of Arts in September 2016, and a BAFTA Fellowship in February 2017. Three of his films ranked in the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy films of the past 100 years (1900\u20132000), all of which ranked in the top 15 of the list: Blazing Saddles at number 6, The Producers at number 11, and Young Frankenstein at number 13.\n\nBrooks was married to Oscar-winning actress Anne Bancroft from 1964 until her death in 2005.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nHerbert Mundin (21 August 1898 \u2013 5 March 1939) was an English-born Hollywood character actor. He was frequently typecast in films as an older cheeky eccentric, a type helped by his jowled features and cheerful disposition.\n\nHe was born Herbert Thomas Mundin in St Helens, then in Lancashire (now part of Merseyside). His father was a nomadic, Primitive Methodist home missionary. His family moved within a short time of his birth to St Albans in Hertfordshire (the 1901 census data reveal that the family lived at St Helens Villa, Paxton Road, St Albans; his parents William and Jane apparently naming their house after the town where they first met and where Herbert was born).\n\nMundin was educated at St Albans School, and joined the Royal Navy during World War I. He began his acting career on the London stage during the 1920s. Mundin first travelled to America on 18 December 1923 for a series of theatrical engagements in New York. He sailed from Southampton on the RMS Aquitania and described himself in ship\u2019s passenger manifest as 5'7\" tall with a fair complexion, brown hair, blue eyes and a scar over his left eye. His big break as an actor was arguably with Gertrude Lawrence and Beatrice Lillie in Charlot's Revue when it appeared on Broadway in 1925.\n\nIn 1931, after working in Australia and London, he permanently moved to the US, where he received a contract with Twentieth Century Fox Studios and enjoyed a successful career as a character actor in over 50 films.\n\nPerhaps his most celebrated role was as Much in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), alongside Errol Flynn. Other film appearances included Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) with Charles Laughton and Clark Gable, and MGM's David Copperfield (1935).\n\nHe died in Van Nuys, California following a car crash. He was killed instantly when the car in which he was riding collided with another car at a street intersection. The force of the impact threw open the door and hurled Mundin to the street.He received a fractured skull and crushed chest.He was 40 years old. The other occupants of the car were not injured.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Herbert Mundin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

He was born in Stockholm. He appeared in over 120 films.\n\nBj\u00f6rnstrand at first had trouble finding work but got an engagement in Helsinki with his wife 1936-1938.

    "biography": "Jarl Kulle (27 February 1927 \u2013 3 October 1997) was a Swedish film and stage actor and director, and father of Maria Kulle.[1]  He was born in the village of Truedstorp, Scania, Sweden and died in Gregersboda, Sweden of bone cancer. Kulle was one of the leading Swedish stage actors of his generation and often appeared in TV productions, at the Royal Dramatic Theatre of Stockholm as well as in a number of films, several of these directed by Ingmar Bergman. Taking on many star parts of the classical and modern repertory, appearing in contemporary TV drama and musicals and armed with remarkable gifts for both comedy, romantic drama and slightly declamatory but controlled pathos, he was one of Sweden's most loved modern actors.  Internationally he's probably most known for his performances in Ingmar Bergman's \"Smiles of a Summer Night\" and \"Fanny and Alexander\".",

Along with award-winning performances in French cinema and television, she has appeared in major films including Inglorious Basterds, Robin Hood, Midnight in Paris, and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol. In 2013 she shared the Palme d'Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival for the film Blue is the Warmest Color. It was announced early 2014 that Lea will be nominated for the Rising Star Award of the BAFTAs.\n\nEarly life\n\nL\u00e9a Seydoux is the daughter of businessman Henri Seydoux and Val\u00e9rie Schlumberger. She has five younger siblings and an older sister, Camille. Seydoux was born in the Parisian district of Passy, but grew up in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Her parents divorced when she was a small child. Through her family involvement in media and entertainment, Seydoux grew up acquainted with prominent artists such as photographer Nan Goldin, Lou Reed, and Mick Jagger.\n\nThe Seydoux family is widely known in France. Her grandfather, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Seydoux, is the chairman of Path\u00e9; her granduncle, Nicolas Seydoux, is the chairman of Gaumont Film Company;her other granduncle, Michel Seydoux, also a cinema producer, is currently the chairman of the Lille football club, LOSC; and her father is CEO of the French wireless company Parrot.\n\nHer mother Val\u00e9rie Schlumberger is a former actress and the founder of the boutique CSAO (Compagnie d'Afrique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et de l'Afrique de l'ouest), which promotes the work of African artists, and Seydoux once worked as a model for their jewelry line Jokko. Schlumberger, who lived in Senegal as a teenager, is also the founder of the charitable organization ASAO (Association pour le S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et l'Afrique de l'Ouest).\n\nSeydoux describes her youthful self as short-haired, slightly disheveled, and widely viewed as a bit strange: \"People liked me, but I always felt like a misfit.\" Still concerned for her shyness in adulthood, Seydoux has admitted to having had an anxiety crisis during the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.",

His first acting roles were as a child in television series, including a lead role in the Western series The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (1963\u20131964). In the 1970s, he signed a ten-year contract with the Walt Disney Company, where he became, according to Robert Osborne, the \"studio's top star of the '70s\". In 1979, Russell was nominated for an Emmy Award for the made-for-television film Elvis. In 1983, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for his performance opposite Meryl Streep in the 1984 film, Silkwood. During the 1980s, Russell was cast in several films by director John Carpenter, including anti-hero roles such as former air force hero-turned robber Snake Plissken in the futuristic action film Escape from New York, Antarctic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady in the horror film The Thing (1982), and truck driver Jack Burton in the dark kung-fu comedy/action film Big Trouble in Little China (1986). Both Escape from New York and Big Trouble in Little China have since become cult films. In 1994, he had a starring role in the military/science fiction film Stargate. In the mid-2000s, his portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks in Miracle (2004) won the praise of critics.

    "biography": "Charlize Theron (born 7 August 1975) is a South African actress, film producer and former fashion model.\n\nShe rose to fame in the late 1990s following roles in the films The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), and The Cider House Rules (1999). Theron received critical acclaim for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster (2003), for which she won the Silver Bear, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Academy Award for Best Actress among several other accolades, becoming the first South African to win an Academy Award in a major acting category. In recent years, she has moved into the field of producing, both in television and film.\n\nShe received further Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for her performance in North Country in 2005, and a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance in Young Adult in 2011. In 2012, she appeared in Snow White & the Huntsman and Prometheus, both of which were box office successes. Theron became a U.S. citizen in 2007, while retaining her South African citizenship.\n\nTheron was born in Benoni, in the then-Transvaal Province of South Africa, the only child of Gerda (n\u00e9e Maritz) and Charles Theron (born 27 November 1947). Second Boer War figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle. Her ancestry includes French, German, and Dutch; her French forebears were early Huguenot settlers in South Africa. \"Theron\" is an Occitan surname (originally spelled Th\u00e9ron) pronounced in Afrikaans as [t\u025c\u02d0ron], although she has said that the way she pronounces it in South Africa is [\u03b8ron]. She changed the pronunciation when she moved to the U.S. to give it a more \"American\" sound.\n\nShe grew up on her parents' farm in Benoni, near Johannesburg. On 21 June 1991, Theron's father, an alcoholic, physically attacked her mother and threatened both her mother and her while drunk; Theron's mother then shot and killed him. The shooting was legally adjudged to have been self-defense and her mother faced no charges.\n\nTheron attended Putfontein Primary School (Laerskool Putfontein), a period she later characterised as not \"fitting in\". At 13, Theron was sent to boarding school and began her studies at the National School of the Arts in Johannesburg. Although Theron is fluent in English, her first language is Afrikaans.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \u00a0\n\nBert Freed (November 3, 1919 \u2014 August 2, 1994) was a prolific American character actor, voice over actor, and the first actor to portray \"Detective Columbo\" on television.\n\nBorn and raised in The Bronx, New York, Freed began acting while attending Penn State University, and made his Broadway debut in 1942. Following World War II Army service in the European Theatre, he appeared in the Broadway musical The Day Before Spring in 1945 and dozens of television shows between 1947 and 1985. His film debut occurred, oddly enough, in a musical Carnegie Hall (1947). A prominent role was as the villainous Ryker in the television series Shane, in which Freed added a unique touch of realism by beginning the show clean-shaven and growing a beard from one week to the next, never shaving again through the season.\n\nFreed played Columbo in a live 1960 episode of the \"Chevy Mystery Theatre\" seven years before Peter Falk played the role. Thomas Mitchell also played the part on stage prior to Falk's version, which is probably where many of the eccentric Columbo traits originated; only a few were visible in Freed's straightforward interpretation, although the character as played by Freed is recognizably Columbo.\n\nHe appeared (sometimes more than once) in television shows such as The Rifleman, Bonanza, Gunsmoke, The Big Valley,The Virginian, Mannix, Barnaby Jones, Charlie's Angels, Then Came Bronson, Run For Your Life, Get Smart, The Lucy Show, Hogan's Heroes, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Dr. Kildare, Ben Casey, Perry Mason, Combat!, Petticoat Junction, The Outer Limits, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Route 66, Ironside, The Green Hornet, The Munsters, and many, many more. He directed one episode of T.H.E. Cat.\n\nFreed appeared as a racist club owner in No Way Out (1950), a gangster in Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1950), a Marine private in Halls of Montezuma (1951 film), an Army sergeant in Take the High Ground! (1953), the Police Chief in Invaders From Mars (1953), Sgt. Boulanger in Paths of Glory (1957), the hangman in Hang 'Em High (1968), Max's father in Wild in the Streets (1968), as Chief of Detectives in Madigan (1968), a homosexual prison guard in There Was a Crooked Man... (1970) and Bernard's father in Billy Jack (1971) in which he got \"whumped\" on the side of the face by Billy Jack's right foot \"just for the hell of it.\"\n\nHe retired from acting in 1986, and died of a heart attack in Canada in 1994 while on a fishing trip with his son.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Bert Freed,\u00a0 licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "A born-and-bred New Yorker, Robert John Burke made his film debut while in his early 20s with a small part in the drama \"The Chosen\" (1981), based on the Chaim Potok story. He went on to study acting at SUNY Purchase where he met aspiring filmmaker Hal Hartley, who cast him as one of the leads in his debut feature \"The Unbelievable Truth,\" an offbeat indie tale where he played a man trying to escape his troubled past. Working with Hartley again on the charming brother-centric dark comedy \"Simple Men,\" Burke caught a major break when Hollywood producers decided that his chiseled jawline was the right one to replace Peter Weller's in the sci-fi/action sequel \"RoboCop 3.\" Despite Burke's efforts, the movie tanked, and he went on to smaller roles in major films, including the lauded Western \"Tombstone\" (1993) and the prison-break movie \"Fled\" (1996). Burke landed his second chance in a Hollywood starring role with the Stephen King adaptation \"Thinner\" (1996), but the macabre tale, which featured him under heavy makeup to depict a callous man who magically loses weight, was deemed almost universally unlikable.Though Burke's leading-man days were mostly behind him, his beastly role in Hartley's \"No Such Thing\" (2001) aside, he soldiered on, and began increasingly working on television with recurring roles on the grim prison drama \"Oz\" and the police procedural \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (NBC, 1999- ). Appearing in George Clooney's first two movies as director, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (2002) and \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" (2005), Burke nonetheless became more familiar to TV audiences, particularly when he signed on to play Mickey Gavin, the ex-priest cousin of Denis Leary's lead character on the firefighter series \"Rescue Me,\" a part that dovetailed with Burke's real-life second job as a New York State fireman.Often cast as a tough guy, the ruggedly handsome and tall actor continued to play imposing figures such as Major General James \"Chaos\" Mattis in the Iraq War miniseries \"Generation Kill\" (HBO, 2008) and Bart Bass, the controlling billionaire father of Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) on the soapy drama \"Gossip Girl.\" Before long, he was juggling his ongoing \"Law & Order: SVU\" part with regular spots on the military drama \"Army Wives\" (Lifetime, 2007- ) and the tense crime show \"Person of Interest\" (CBS, 2011- ), while still finding time for supporting turns in films, including the Denzel Washington/Mark Wahlberg action movie \"2 Guns\" (2013).",

    "biography": "Born Lucille Fay LeSueur in San Antonio, Texas, but christened Joan Crawford by Hollywood, she exemplified the 1920s carefree \"flapper\" era to a 'T'. Her beauty and vivacity catapulted her to stardom in the late 1920s in the hugely popular silent film Our Dancing Daughters. Ever since that point, the resilient actress with the ever expressive eyes, the famous over-painted lips and the will of steel created for herself one of the most legendary and enduring Hollywood personae of all time. Receiving three Best Actress Oscar nominations throughout her long career and winning once for 1945's Mildred Pierce, Joan seemed to personify the ideal American woman of every decade, from the uproarious 1920s right up until her death as a semi-reclusive corporate widow on May 10, 1977. Her fourth and last marriage was to Pepsi Cola chairman Alfred Steele, who died in 1959.\n\nShe was described by some as 'The Face' owing to her classically beautiful features. Great Hollywood studio photographer George Hurrell dubbed her \"camera proof\" as she photographed perfectly from every angle. She also won a British BAFTA award for the 1957 movie The Story of Esther Costello.\n\nHer film career spanning nearly fifty years, she is best remembered for classic performances in Our Dancing Daughters (1928), Grand Hotel (1932), The Women (1939), Mildred Pierce (1945), Humoresque (1946), Possessed (1947), Harriet Craig (1950), Sudden Fear (1952), and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

    "biography": "Offbeat funnyman Martin Mull was born in Chicago, Illinois, the oldest of three children, and raised in Ohio. The blond-maned, blue-eyed comedian with the sad, droopy mustache first came in contact with the arts by honing in on his innate talents as a painter. In order to pay his art school tuition, he started organizing bands. At around the same time, he discovered that stand-up comedy was another way to allow his creative juices to flow. Martin's early recognition as a humorist led to a recording contract, and, over the years, he would be Grammy-nominated several times for a number of eccentric comedy albums. His gimmick and allure came in the form of a dry, humorless delivery and a bland, highly conservative-looking demeanor, which masked a sly, witty and ultra-hip philosophy. Gaining popularity in the 1970s, he finally broke into TV with the cult soap opera parody \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" (1976) in which he played Garth Gimble, a volatile wife abuser whose comeuppance occurred in the form of an aluminum Christmas tree (impaled) in his home closet. Martin was so popular on the show that he was resurrected in the spin-off series \"Fernwood 2 Night\" (1977) as twin brother Barth Gimble, who was a co-host of the town's television program along with Fred Willard's Jerry Hubbard character. After this peak, Martin became a sought-after guest on the talk show circuit, not to mention variety specials and TV movies. He tried his hand at producing and starring in his own sitcom \"Domestic Life\" (1984) but the series failed. He also added his special brand of merriment to films over the years, some of them being decent, such as FM (1978), Serial (1980), Mr. Mom (1983) and Clue (1985) in the role of the tweedy-looking Colonel Mustard, while most have been either formula schtick or just plain drivel, as in Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Rented Lips (1988), which he produced and wrote, Cutting Class (1989), Far Out Man (1990) with Cheech &amp; Chong, and Mr. Write (1994). Martin's first passion has always been art and the distinguished multi-media artist's work has been showcased in galleries throughout the world. He also authored the book \"Painting, Drawing and World,\" which is a compilation of ten years of his work. Mull is married to a composer and musician, Wendy, and they have a daughter.

    "biography": "Character actor John P. Ryan was born on July 30, 1936 in New York City. The son of Irish immigrant parents, Ryan graduated from Rice High School and studied English at the City College of New York, where he first developed an interest in acting. He served six years in the US Army and worked as a welfare investigator prior to pursuing an acting career. John made his film debut in the 1967 comedy \"The Tiger Makes Out.\" He appeared in five pictures for Jack Nicholson; he's especially memorable as male nurse Spicer in \"Five Easy Pieces.\" Manic, pale-eyed and craggy-faced, with an often intense and explosive screen presence, Ryan was frequently cast as nasty villains, hard-boiled police officers, and strict military men. John gave a strong and touching performance in a rare change-of-pace sympathetic role as Frank Davis, the bitter and regretful father of a murderous monster mutant baby in Larry Cohen's excellent \"It's Alive.\" He also portrayed Davis in the okay sequel \"It Lives Again.\" Other notable movie parts include the fanatical Colonel Hardcore in \"Shamus,\" shrewd mob capo Patsy O'Neill in the witty \"Cops and Robbers,\" evil scientist Schneider in \"Futureworld,\" the dogged Lt. Parmental in \"Breathless,\" vicious Irish mobster Joe Flynn in \"The Cotten Club;\" at his ferocious best as sadistic prison Warden Ranken in the powerful \"Runaway Train,\" hateful fascist lunatic Glastenbury in the exciting \"Avenging Force,\" ruthless drug kingpin Nathan White in the cruddy \"Death Wish IV: The Crackdown,\" ramrod high school principal Mr. O'Rourke in the amusing \"Three O'Clock High,\" and lethal robot history teacher Mr. Hardin in \"Class of 1999.\" Among the TV shows Ryan did guest spots on are \"M.A.S.H.,\" \"The Rockford Files,\" \"Hawaii Five-O,\" \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,\" \"Starsky &amp; Hutch,\" \"Kojak,\" \"Hart to Hart,\" \"The F.B.I.,\" and \"Miami Vice.\" John had a recurring role on the TV series \"Archer.\" In addition to his film and TV credits, Ryan also appeared in over 90 stage plays. Following his final film appearance in \"Bound,\" John spent his later years giving acting lessons and was an advocate of spiritual healing. John P. Ryan died from a stroke at age 70 on March 20, 2007 in Los Angeles, California; he's survived by two daughters.",

A member of the Arquette acting family, he first became known during the late 1990s after starring in several Hollywood films, including the Scream series. He has since had several television roles, including playing \"Jason Ventress\" on ABC's In Case of Emergency. In addition to his acting career Arquette took a brief foray into professional wrestling in early 2000, competing for World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

Savage held 20 championships during his professional wrestling career. He held six\u00a0world titles\u00a0between the WWF and WCW, having won the\u00a0WWF Championship\u00a0twice and the\u00a0WCW World Heavyweight Championship\u00a0four times. He also won the\u00a0ICW World Heavyweight Championship\u00a0three times and the\u00a0USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship\u00a0once. A\u00a0one-time\u00a0WWF Intercontinental Champion, WWE (formerly WWF) has named Savage as the greatest champion of all time and credited him for bringing \"a higher level of credibility to the title through his amazing in-ring performances.\"\u00a0He was also the\u00a01987 WWF King of the Ring\u00a0and the\u00a01995 WCW World War 3\u00a0winner.

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \u00a0\n\nJean Martin (March 6, 1922 \u2013 February 2, 2009) was a French actor of stage and screen. Martin served in the French Resistance during World War II and later fought with the French paratroopers in Indochina. Theatrically, he is perhaps best-known for originating two roles in Samuel Beckett's most famous plays: Lucky in Waiting for Godot, and Clov in Endgame. During the 1950s, he was a performer at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire and also worked for radio plays.\n\nMaking over eighty film and television appearances, Martin is best remembered by international audiences for his role as the French paratroop commander Col. Mathieu in The Battle of Algiers (1965), as well as villainous roles in My Name is Nobody and The Day of the Jackal (both 1973). He was one of the protagonists in Les Compagnons de Baal (1968).\n\nMost of his other screen work was in French or European cinema, and his stage performances have gained him much more recognition and acclaim than his film work. Martin was also an active political leftist, and was fired from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire for signing the manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War. He was also blacklisted from radio work and remained unemployed for a time as a result.\n\nMartin was hired for The Battle of Algiers because director Gillo Pontecorvo was looking for a little-known professional actor to play the part of Col. Mathieu. Martin had by then worked extensively on stage, but had done just a few appearances on screen. Enjoying to work in movies and wishing to develop his film career, Martin applied for the part and was hired. Martin later explained that his working relationship with Pontecorvo on the set of The Battle of Algiers was often difficult, as the director otherwise hired non-professional actors for the film. Martin, as the film's only professional actor, was sometimes uncomfortable working with untrained performers, while Pontecorvo was worried that their acting styles might be too different from each other and work against the picture. Martin was ultimately very happy with the film.\n\nJean Martin continued working on stage and on screen, playing a variety supporting roles in French films and television productions. He also provided the voice of the bird in the French animation feature Le Roi et l'oiseau.\n\nMartin died from cancer in Paris on 2 February 2009, aged 86.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean Martin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Christopher Walken (born Ronald Walken, usually called \"Chris\") is an American stage and screen actor.\n\nHe has appeared in more than 100 movies and television shows. Walken was born Ronald Walken (named after actor Ronald Colman) into a Methodist family in Astoria, Queens, New York. His mother, Rosalie, was a Scottish immigrant from Glasgow, and his father, Paul Walken, emigrated from Germany in 1928 with his brothers, Wilhelm and Alois. His father was a baker and his mother worked as a window dresser. Influenced by their mother's own dreams of stardom, he and his brothers Kenneth and Glenn were child actors on television in the 1950s. Walken studied at Hofstra University on Long Island, but did not graduate. Walken initially trained as a dancer in music theatre at the Washington Dance Studio before moving on to dramatic roles in theatre and then film. Walken is imitated for his deadpan affect, sudden off-beat pauses, and strange speech rhythm, in a manner similar to William Shatner. He is revered for his quality of danger and menace, but his unpredictable deliveries and expressions make him invaluable in comedy as well. Walken is noted for refusing movie roles only rarely, having stated in interviews that he will decline a role only if he is simply too busy on other projects to take it. He regards each role as a learning experience. Walken has been married to Georgianne Walken (born Thon) since 1969; she is a casting director, most notably for The Sopranos. They live in Connecticut and have no children (Walken has stated in interviews that not having children is one of the reasons he has had such a prolific career). In regard to his villainous roles preceding him when meeting new people, Walken says, \"When they see me in a movie, they expect me to be something nasty ... That's why it's good to defy expectations sometimes.\"",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nDave Willock (August 13, 1909 \u2013 November 12, 1990) was an American character actor. Willock appeared in 181 films and television series from 1939 to 1989.  Born in 1909, Willock began his professional career in vaudeville in 1931, teaming with his boyhood friend Jack Carson in a comedy song and dance routine. For a time in the mid-1930s he was a reporter and editor for a Milwaukee newspaper. He first appeared on screen in Good Girls Go to Paris (1939), in an uncredited bit part.\n\nHe teamed with Carson again when Carson invited him to write for his radio show; Willock wrote and played the part of Carson's nephew Tugwell on The Jack Carson Show from 1943\u20131949. Willock and Cliff Arquette had their own radio and television shows in the early 1950s. Both versions were called Dave and Charley; the radio version was heard circa 1950, but the television version of it was on the air for only three months in early 1952.\n\nIn the 1961\u20131962 season, he played Harvey Clayton, father of the 1920s teenager Margie Clayton, portrayed by Cynthia Pepper in ABC's Margie. He appeared on an episode of Dragnet as an ex-vaudevillean who is cheated out of $9,000 that he found on a sidewalk. In 1966, he had an uncredited role as the bartender in the Elvis Presley vehicle Frankie and Johnny. Willock is probably most familiar to modern audiences from his performance as Baby Jane Hudson's father in the opening scenes of the cult classic What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). He played seven different characters on CBS's Green Acres with Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor, mostly portraying clerks or elevator operators.\n\nWillock also did voice acting for animated roles, such as the offscreen narrator on Wacky Races (1968) and as father Augustus \"Gus\" Holiday on The Roman Holidays (1972). He appeared in a television commercial for \"The Great American Soups\", directed by American satirist Stan Freberg, alongside tap-dancing star Ann Miller.\n\nHe died of complications due to stroke on November 12, 1990 at the age of 81. He is buried in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery. For his contribution to the television industry, Dave Willock has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6358 Hollywood Boulevard.",

He is noted for the Bat Out of Hell album trilogy consisting of Bat Out of Hell, Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. Bat Out of Hell has sold more than 43 million copies. After more than 30 years, it still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually, and stayed on the charts for over nine years, making it one of the best selling albums of all time. Although he enjoyed success with Bat Out of Hell and Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell, and earned a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo for a track on the latter album, Meat Loaf experienced some initial difficulty establishing a steady career within his native US. However, he has retained iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the UK, where he ranks 23rd for number of weeks overall spent on the charts. He ranked 96th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.\" Meat Loaf has also appeared in over 50 movies or television shows, sometimes as himself, or as characters resembling his stage persona. His most notable roles include Eddie in the American premiere of The Rocky Horror Show and in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Robert \"Bob\" Paulson in Fight Club.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Meat Loaf, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nHelmut Griem (born April 6, 1932 in Hamburg \u2013 November 19, 2004 in Munich) was a German actor.\n\nGriem was primarily a German-speaking stage actor, appearing at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, the Burgtheater in Vienna, the Staatliches Schauspielb\u00fchnen in Berlin, in the Munich Kammerspiele, and finally in the Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz, also in Munich.\n\nAmong his many film and TV appearances (a quite memorable one being NBC's mini-series Peter the Great, portraying the formidable Tsar's lifelong friend and \"right hand\" Alexander Menshikov, alongside Maximilian Schell), the Oscar-winning film Cabaret (1972), in which he played the rich \"Baron Maximilian von Heune\" is probably the best-known; other internationally-known performances include his work in The Damned, The McKenzie Break, and Ludwig. Griem starred in the television mini-series \"The Devil's Lieutenant\" directed by John Goldschmidt, adapted by Jack Rosenthal and based on the novel by M Fagyas, for Channel 4 and ZDF.\n\nDespite his success in film, the theatre remained at the heart of Griem's work, and he performed in many classic roles from both the German and English-language repertoire. Later in his career Griem turned to theatre direction, including Long Day's Journey Into Night by Eugene O'Neill. Before his death, Griem had planned to direct the Botho Strauss play Die eine and die andere (This One and The Other).\n\nGriem twice won the Bambi Award: in 1961 and in 1976.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Helmut Griem, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Was an American actor. His parents were Charles who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy and Anna who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield's famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in \"Harvey\". In 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson in From Here to Eternity (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as \"heavies\" in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty Piletti, a shy and sensitive butcher, in Marty (1955). He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, despite strong competition from Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, James Dean and James Cagney. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Borgnine performed memorably in such films as The Catered Affair (1956), Ice Station Zebra (1968) and Emperor of the North (1973). Between 1962 and 1966, he played Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the popular television series McHale's Navy (1962). In early 1984, he returned to television as Dominic Santini in the action series Airwolf (1984) co-starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and in 1995, he was cast in the comedy series The Single Guy (1995) as doorman Manny Cordoba. He also appeared in several made-for-TV movies. Ernest Borgnine passed away aged 95 on July 8, 2012, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, of renal failure. He is survived by his wife Tova, their children and his younger sister Evelyn.",

He started appearing in films in 1992 and soon began making his mark in such notable works as Ji-Wun Kim\u2019s The Quiet Family (1998). Commercial success came his way in 1999, when he played a North Korean spy in Kang Je-Gyu\u2019s blistering action film, Shiri, a huge box office smash. In 2002 he received international acclaim by starring in Chihwaseon, a film by Korea\u2019s most revered director, Kwon-Taek Im. As the nineteenth-century painter Seung-Up Jang, Choi created a vivid portrait of a proudly vulgar artist who both upset aristocratic artistic norms and altered the shape of Korean painting. Choi Min-Sik has said that he created the character, OH Dae-su, in Oldboy in a very different manner than Chihwaseon. Choi said he felt a responsibility to bring back to life the painter JANG Seung-Up in Chihwaseon, while in Oldboy OH Dae-su is the absolute product of his imagination. At various points during 2006 Choi (and several other Korean filmmakers, though separately from Choi) demonstrated in Seoul and at the Cannes Film Festival against the Korean decision to reduce the Film Quota from 146 to 73 days. While not successful (the reduced quota stands), the market share of Korean films remains at the top of the box office, with 7 of the top 10 films this year remaining homegrown (the same rate as in 2005). \u00a0 - From asianmediawiki.com",

His early acting career included roles on Broadway, radio, television and in film, usually as the villain. He won two Emmy Awards in 1959 and 1961 for the role of Perry Mason, which he played for nine seasons between 1957 and 1966. His second hit series, Ironside, earned him six Emmy nominations, and two Golden Globe nominations. He is also known for his role as Steve Martin in both Godzilla, King of the Monsters! and Godzilla 1985.\n\nIn addition to acting, Burr owned an orchid business and had begun to grow a vineyard. He was a collector of wines and art, and was very fond of cooking.\n\nAfter his death from cancer in 1993, Burr's personal life came into question as details of his known biography appeared to be unverifiable. Gradually, it was revealed that Burr had possibly contrived a life story that hid his homosexuality.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Raymond Burr, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Ken Takakura\u00a0 , born Gouichi Oda (\u00a0 February 16, 1931, in Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b, Fukuoka, Japan), is a Japanese actor best known for his brooding style and the stoic presence he brings to his roles. Takakura gained his streetwise swagger and tough-guy persona watching yakuza turf battles over the lucrative black market and racketeering in postwar Fukuoka. This subject was covered in one of his most famous movies, Showa Zankyo-den (Remnants of Chivalry in the Showa Era), in which he played an honorable old-school yakuza among the violent post-war gurentai.\n\nA graduate of Meiji University in Tokyo Takakura happened by an audition in 1955 at the Toei Film Company, and decided to look in. Toei found a natural in Takakura as he debuted with Denko Karate Uchi (Lightning Karate Blow) in 1956. Japan experienced a boom in gangster films in the 1960s as the Japanese people struggled with the generational differences between those raised in pre-war and post-war Japan and these were Takakura's stock and trade. His breakout role would be in the 1965 film Abashiri Prison, and its sequel Abashiri Bangaichi: Bokyohen (Abashiri Prison: Longing for Home, also 1965), in which he played an ex-con antihero. By the time Takakura would leave Toei in 1976, he had appeared in over 180 films.\n\nTakakura gained international recognition after starring in the 1970 war film Too Late the Hero as the cunning Imperial Japanese Major Yamaguchi, the 1975 Sydney Pollack sleeper hit The Yakuza with Robert Mitchum and is probably best known in the West for his role in Ridley Scott's Black Rain (1989) where he surprises American cops played by Michael Douglas and Andy Garc\u00eda with the line, \"I do speak fucking English\". He again proved himself bankable to Western audiences with the 1992 Fred Schepisi comedy Mr. Baseball starring Tom Selleck.\n\nWhile he has slowed down a bit in his older years, he is still active. His most recent film was the 2005 Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles by Chinese director Zhang Yimou.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ken Takakura, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

    "biography": "Anna Wintour, OBE (born November 3, 1949) is the British-born editor-in-chief of American Vogue, a position she has held since 1988. With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses, Wintour has become an institution throughout the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname \"Nuclear Wintour\".\n\nShe is the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, editor of the London Evening Standard. Anna became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later she moved to the United States, with stints at New York and House & Garden. She returned home for a year to turn around British Vogue, and later assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.\n\nA former personal assistant, Lauren Weisberger, wrote the 2003 bestselling roman \u00e0 clef The Devil Wears Prada, later made into a successful film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a fashion editor widely believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009 she was the focus of another film, R.J. Cutler's documentary The September Issue.",

He was raised in a Jewish observant household.\n\nAdler began his theatre career as a stage manager in 1951, working on such productions as Of Thee I Sing and My Fair Lady before becoming a production supervisor for The Apple Tree, Black Comedy/White Lies, Dear World, Coco, 6 Rms Riv Vu, Annie, and I Remember Mama, among others. He made his directing debut with the 1974 Sammy Cahn revue Words and Music and also directed the 1976 revival of My Fair Lady, which garnered him a Drama Desk Award nomination, and the ill-fated 1981 musical The Little Prince and the Aviator. He also directed the 1976 play Checking Out.\n\nAs an actor, Adler is perhaps best known for his roles as Herman \"Hesh\" Rabkin in The Sopranos, Mr. Wicker in Mad About You, and Lt. Al Teischler in Hudson Street. He made three appearances on Northern Exposure as Alan Schulman, Joel Fleischman's old neighborhood rabbi seen in visions. His screen credits include In Her Shoes, Manhattan Murder Mystery, and The Public Eye. In addition, Adler also appeared in an episode of The West Wing as Toby Ziegler's father, Jules Ziegler. The elder Ziegler worked as a member of Murder, Inc. in the 50's. Adler is now appearing as the new chief in the fourth season of FX's fire fighter drama Rescue Me.

    "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nHector William \"Harry\" Cording (26 April 1891 \u2013 1 September 1954) was a British character actor.\n\nCording was born Hector William Cording on 26 April 1891 in Wellington, Somerset. He was brought up and was educated in his native England, and later settled permanently in Los Angeles, where he began a film career. His first role was as a henchmen in The Knockout (1925), followed by similar roles over the next few years. Cording appeared in many Hollywood films from the 1920s to the 1950s. With an imposing six-foot height, stocky build, and perhaps due to his uncomfortable resemblance to veteran film bad guy Oskar Homolka, \"Harry the Henchman\" usually portrayed thugs, villains' henchmen and policemen.\n\nCording's most notable roles were probably as the villainous Dickon Malbete, Captain of the Guard in Errol Flynn's Adventures of Robin Hood and as Thamal, the hulking henchman to Bela Lugosi's character in 1934's Black Cat. As a contract player at Universal Pictures in the 1940s, he turned up in tiny parts in many of their horror films, such as The Wolf Man.\n\nHaving appeared in a bit role in 20th Century-Fox's Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone (1939), he went on to appear in supporting and bit parts in seven of the twelve Universal Studios Sherlock Holmes films in which Rathbone starred.\n\nCording died on 1 September 1954. The cause of death was not documented. His wife was Margaret Cording, n\u00e9e Fiero, (1912\u201391), a native of Michigan; their daughter, Margaret Rose, was born on 7 November 1939. The Cordings lived at 4104 Farmdale Avenue, North Hollywood. Harry Cording was an active member of the Loyal Order of Moose fraternity.",

As a young adult, Elizabeth studied acting and was a model represented by the Bonnie Kay Agency prior to making her dream of becoming a film actress a reality. She landed small roles in a few A pictures (like Woody Allen's Zelig and Arthur Hiller's The Lonely Guy) before graduating to leads in B films. Her first top-billed role came by chance when she was passing a casting agent's office, was spotted and then hired to play the lead role in Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity (1987). Appearances in numerous horror films in the 80s into the early 90s (she was victim to both the Santa Claus killer in Silent Night, Deadly Night Part II and Jason in Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood) earned her the reputation as being a Scream Queen, though her comedic talents were also put to good use in numerous films, including playing a bubbly but none-too-bright go-go girl in the video and cable favorite Assault of the Killer Bimbos (1988).",

    "biography": "Born Sharon Lafaye Jones in Augusta, Georgia, she moved to New York City at an early age. With a gifted voice, performing gospel songs in Church, since childhood, she has only recently received acclaim by the public and her peers in the areas of Soul, Funk and Rhythm and Blues. Until the late 90s she was still employed at her \"day Job\" as a Correction Officer at NYC's Rikers Island. Initially a backup session singer, she impressed Record Executives and - Producers Gabriel Roth and Philip Lehman, when she was the only one to show up for a recording session, and demonstrated her ability to sing on several different backup tracks. \"Sharon Jones and The Dap Kings\" were formed In 2002. They were comprised of Sharon Jones backed by members from three bands.From \"The Soul Providers\", Bosco Mann on bass, guitarist Binky Griptite, percussionist Fernando Velez, trumpet player Anda Szilagyi and organist Earl Maxton. They were joined by \"The Mighty Imperials\"s saxophonist Leon Michels and drummer Homer Steinweiss plus Neal Sugarman from \"Sugarman 3\". As \"Sharon Jones and The Dap Kings\", the band has released several critically acclaimed albums including \"Naturally\" (2005) and \"I Learned the Hard Way (2010). A milestone in her career occurred in 2007 when she appeared in the film, \"The Great Debaters\", where she played \"Lila\" and sang \"That's What My Baby Likes\". Additioanlly, in the film's soundtrack, Sharon performs the Gospel classics \"Up Above My Head\" and \"Two Wings\". This film appearance along with the soundtrack music introduced Sharon to a much larger audience.
